	FINISH SAVE COMPAT
	
	
	So, I know that multiple-partner sex's implementation is still being worked on, but since the Spitroast option for slaves exists currently, I feel like I should tell you the issue that I ran into. Whenever I would initiate the spitroast, at first both slaves would appear as the dominant on the right, but after a few turns, one of them (almost always the second slave for me) would do something, causing the other slave to disappear from the right and not do anything anymore. From then on, only the slave who took the original action would be part of the scene. For reference (though I don't know if this matters) my character is a greater incubus and the slaves are both greater succubi. 
	
	Hey there, found a bug in the hotfix for the most recent version, 0.1.97.
	  With Liliya, the character's aunt, I cannot get her to impregnate the character.
	    I have tried matching the character's orgasm to Liliya's with always using the 'stay in position' option, with both sex positions, and Liliya still always pulls out to cum on the floor, instead of inside.
Same thing happened with Kate as well.  I haven't explored further, but I hope it does not apply when your character is initiating sex with any other NPC.  I did get my character pregnant by the horse merchant, though.
	
	If you're on the receiving end of non-consensual sex with an dick giving npc, and they reach orgasm but you have not, you will stay on the "receive creampie" and "request pullout" screen until your character would have reached orgasm, but with no buildup or show there of. If this sounds confusing for you, say you're at 25 arousal while they're at 100 arousal, you will stay on the "request/do not request creampie page, but you will have to press one of the buttons based on the number of turns it would have taken you to reach 100 arousal yourself. While this is happening, nothing changes appearance wise in game until you reach 100 arousal, at which point the game proceeds normally.
	
	: I seem to be getting a lot of duplicate options in the Lilaya sex scene. I'm also getting the 'bounce' options despite being in the standing position (not sure if that one is intentional)
	
	Enslaved a horse-girl, beat up Brax, went to Lilaya's place, prepared some double slave rooms, went to move my new slave to the room and set her job, and Brax's stats show up in the right side.
	
	Also, when starting from a character import, things such like meeting Brax are preserved, so he'll complain about Candi letting you in "again" the first time you meet.
	
	Masc characters with no genitals, and their crotch covered, are assumed to be cuntboys or butches depending on the presence of breasts.
Masc characters with a vagina, and their crotch covered, are assumed to be males or busty-boys depending on the presence of breasts.
This is weird, and it should probably be consistent for both cases, since mannequins look like cuntboys, but cuntboys apparently look like males.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Set up doggy test sex scene
		Text for positions
	
	
	Sex action stats (stamina, lust, arousal)
	
	improving the fetishes/sex experience
	Fetish levels and experience
	Fetishes should boost in power based on experience level
	
	Check oral/anal/vaginal allowed for stocks
	
	
	Corruption - fetish bypasses
	Stamina - drained by actions (minor) and orgasms (major). If falls to 0, can't continue/exhausted.
	Lust - gained by actions character likes. Drained by actions character doesn't like. Determines pace.
		Player actions now increase/decrease lust instead of setting pace immediately
	
	
	Lust should not determine pace. Instead, it should lock out the opposite extremes. So at minimum, can't use eager stuff.
	Actions still determine pace.
	
	
	Sex starts:
	- Each character has a starting lust, based on other character's attraction
	- Sex continues as normal, with each action affecting lust, arousal, & stamina
		- If arousal >= 100 AND PHYSICAL STIMULATION ON EROGONOUS ZONE, orgasm
		- If stamina drops to 0, that character stops (or if sub, is too exhausted to make a move)
		- Set pace to corresponding lust pace
	- Sex stops once doms all run out of stamina, or if NPC dom achieves objectives.
	
	
	
	
	Sex experience (determines arousal gain)
		Fetish boosts xp and lust gains for those actions
		'Turn-off' makes you lose lust when subjected to those actions

	Add forced TF to offer body
	
	submissive sex option for offspring
	
	
	you should have two statuses, at least, for pure virgins who lose it
		One where they see themselves as worthless fuckmeat
		That would be what happens if they actually start having second thoughts during the sex scene and it isn't somehow negated
		The other one would be something like 'virgin unleashed' where they revel in it
		"I kept myself pure when I could have been doing this? I'm going to make up for lost time."
		Which would have a heavy corruption boost, but they'd gain a significant bonus to seduction, sexuality, stamina, etc.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	I'll go through and check to make sure that it's correctly respecting your content preferences for the next release (i.e. if you have non-con turned off, they should always respect your requests)
	
	"Stop partner" doesn't do anything seemingly anywhere it's available. In fact, you just end up skipping your turn and your partner performs actions twice to make up for it.
		[I'll make it so that the NPC is blocked from starting any ongoing action on the turn immediately after you get them to stop.]
	
	I kept playing the game to see if it was a fluke, the game won't let me click the beg for pullout, but when I just click inventory, the phone until my arousal becomes high, I become able to click beg to cum inside.
	
	when you highlight text and proceed with an action, the came refuses to accept mouse input, hotkeys and arrow navigation still work though (this means you cannot save, apart from autosaves since you can't click the buttons)
	
	If you try to add too many slaves to the public use profession (it doesn't actually let you bypass the cap), it'll prevent you from entering the room in the Slaver District until you take one slave away from the profession.
	
	I'm wearing boyshorts and a chemise. I got anal creampied, the chemise gets dirty, not boyshorts. Changed into another chemise, it got dirty again.

	would it be possible to be able to add your offspring to the cell you're standing in via buggy
	
	 a request to be able to access a slave's inventory when you interact with them
	
	Suggestions:

		Maybe the “Anal Fingering” action should have the “Masturbation” fetish applied to it?
		
		It might be a good idea to block NPCs from doing the “spread pussy/ass” action if you’re already fucking them.
		
		There really should be a way to access a slave’s inventory while talking to them.
		
		It would be good if, during sex scenes, it remembered which tab you’re on when an orgasm reaction comes up; as of now, you get switched to the “Misc. Actions” tab, rather than back to the one you were on.
		
		It might be an idea for finger sucking (and tail sucking for demons) to be limited to those with the “Oral Performer” fetish. Quickly getting them wet is one thing, but keeping on sucking them is kind of weird, unless it’s a stand in for some other kind of sucking they’d rather be doing.
		
		If a wandering NPC is addicted to you, maybe their encounter rate should go up as they go into withdrawal? I mean, they should be actively seeking you out, right?
		
		Currently, when you leave a wandering NPC, they get brand new clothing for six of their slots (less the bra if they have no breasts). Presently, they always seem to get this, but maybe they sometimes shouldn’t. It might be nice if NPCs didn’t always bother with underwear, or for some items of underwear, they don’t really need anything on top — the bikini and croptop spring to mind here, and I’ve used the boyshorts as a stand-in for athletic wear before too. Exhibitionist NPCs might not bother with anything, going topless or even full nude.
		
		Bug Reports:
		
		The introduction for prostitutes refers to slutty clothes and heavy makeup, but as far as I can see they actually wear pretty much the same outfits as any other NPC, and don’t necessarily wear makeup either (and males don’t seem to ever wear makeup without the crossdressing fetish).
		
		In character descriptions, “dark grey” text appears as red.
		
		I went to the slavery screen, opened a slave’s inventory, then clicked on their name at the top-right to examine them. What I got was not them, but the last NPC I examined out in the city.
		
		During a sex scene, on the NPC’s turn, instead of them taking an action it played out that I was spreading my ass out for them.
		
	
	
	
	the prepare button seems to have broken mutual orgasms. it resolves the PC first and they pull out before the other person cums. making the followup scene be as if they came without penetrative action.
	
	Lost virginity to an Incubus and the broken virgin fetish lines were referring to the Incubus as "she" and "her".
	
	Patreon icons
	
	move all of the slave management stuff to your phone
	
	
	Just made a harpy slave androphilic and got this text:
Olivia is now <i style='color:#ea5d76;'>command_unknown</i>!
	
	Finish Arthur side quest to use slaves as test subjects
	Also add watch use descriptions
	
	
	: BUG: So when I'm letting the other party dom, let's say it's a girl. A girl making my character pound into her doggy-style.
	 There is this irritating tendency for them, RIGHT when the arousal gauges are a hair away from climax, to suddenly switch into another position.
	  Suddenly, she's pinning him down cowgirl, BUT: that switch in position pulled him out of her, and that was the turn his arousal hit 100.
	   Because she switched positions RIGHT THEN, even though both partners want him to cum inside, he's technically not inside when he cums, so he can't.
	
	also, i noticed that after i started a new game from regular play, when i was customizing my character (masculinity, body type, orientation, etc) instead of my new characters name, it said the name of a demon slave i had who i had customized with the demon transform menu. just wanted to let you know i somehow broke your game like that. 
	
	I just find it a little offsetting that anything but jerking off makes you lose penile virginity. Hotdogging and getting a titty shouldn't do that, maybe.
	
	Importing characters as slaves needs to reset pregnancies and sex stats
	
	move the slave management overview to the player's phone
	
	[blocks & requires access same for both clothing is causing this]
	more chemise problems: when wearing both a chemise and pantyhose (SOCK_TIGHTS), the AI gets stuck in a loop trying to decide which they need to pull up/down first, causing the game to softlock
	
	
	got a bug when i was changing what my slave calls me i accidentally pressed enter when the box was empty and the whole middle section disappear, and i couldn't do any thing else expect close the game. 
		I tried to reproduce it and it's quite easy to redo just press enter when the text box for "what she calls you?" is empty. The slave in question is scarlett
	
	
	
	also have a couple small bugs in the importer:
	-while the clothing stats now carry over properly and no longer cause negatives when removed, i wound up getting that bug from a chaos feather i had that had +3 Int.
	-second, and extremely minor, i found that importing a character and skipping the prologue does not give you the crystal or money you get for going through the prologue. granted, if you're importing a character, you probably don't need it, but it's still a little bit annoying to my ingrained rpg "get all the things" instincts. :P
	
	Add skip sex button
	
	removing and adding penis doesn't work for penile virginity
	
	[use colour]
	'horse-like' and 'squirrel-like' et al really aren't sexy eye descriptors
	
	you can tell that giving harpies beaks isn't fully supported yet. Kissing: 'you slide your tongue past her full lips'
	
	And now here's an odd one:
		If you have enchanted (green/blue, doesn't matter) panties (also doesn't matter which exactly, anything in the groin slot apart from the groinless options) and an unenchanted pantyhose, and then get creampied—ass or vagina, doesn't matter—then your pantyhose gets dirtied, not your panties. If the pantyhose is enchanted as well or if the pantyhose is enchanted and the panties are unenchanted, it works normally and dirties the panties.
		And in that same vein: If you have an enchanted pantyhose and any—enchanted or unenchanted—onepiece bodysuit or swimsuit, then getting creampied dirties the onepiece, even though it's supposed to go over the pantyhose. All other enchantment configurations seem to work normally.
	
	[old tooltip bug]
	I can't add any points in my skill tree that is on the right side. i.e, i can't get runner, flirty, barren etc, but i can get arcane power.
	
	
	There seems to be a memory leak every time you load a save. The RAM usage just keeps piling up until the game slows to a crawl. Takes a while to become noticeable, and probably varies from machine to machine.
	Using the .jar version here with an old-ish version of Java, 1.8.0_131.
	
	Check NPC generatePotion
		won't make your balls any bigger in successive encounters. So if they give you a cock and balls, your stuck with tiny balls unless you use a potion to make them bigger
		Forgot to mention they also won't grow your nipples/areola, change your muscles/body size, change your hair color and makeup, change your tongue length, or give you modifiers such as puffy anything(nips, vag, anus, urethra). I'm not sure if these just haven't been implemented yet but I think they should be at some point.
	[fixed, but needs more work]
	There's still a bug with Forced TF that only changes your genitalia to be male or female. Also, Transformation Test Subject only gives one TF instead of 3.
	Also, I had a cat boy who tried to turn me into a harpy-girl, but kept on using human TF potions on my human character. That was in the pre-hotfix version, tho. Not sure if it's still there, but I don't see anything in the changelog about that.
	
	
	Slaves assigned to cooking duty have reduced impact from negative obedience compared to the other jobs. (0.05* Obedience) as opposed to (0.1* Obedience) like with maid duty and librarian duty. 
		(If anything since they're being trusted to prepare food it seems like being trust worthy/ having high obedience would be even more important. Cause a slave that handles your food is in a prime position to do unsavory things to it. They probably can't poison you cause of the slave collar but it probably doesnt stop them from doing things like spitting in your food eh?)
	
	if you encounter a halloween succubus and a reindeer on the same tile the succubus will get the reindeer's name
	
	Plantigrade, Digitigrade, Unguligrade as leg TF
	
	alleyway demons do not appear to have behavior for inducing transformations, period

	2) "Fixed forced TF bug (where all NPCs would keep giving you human penis or vagina parts even if they wanted to turn you into something else)."
		This one seems to still be around, unfortunately. Unless it's tied to me keeping my preferences file from the 0.1.95.
		The workaround seems to be to give yourself the right genitals (species and sex) for what the NPC was trying to turn you into, at which point they'll start TFing you again.
	 Sorry to report, but the forced transformation bug with human parts is still happening.
	
	I seem to be having a lot of trouble getting dominant buttsluts to ever initiate anal. You would expect a buttslut, in the absence of other fetishes to take precedence, to want cock up their butt... but nope, they keep picking thigh sex.
	
	: i made a potion that adds 5 fitness and when i drank it the message appeared twice. It still only added 5+ and not 10+
	
	double dildo, strap ons and tribbing/scissors
	
	using tail to grope breasts
	
	Speaking of which, Innoxia, if you're reading this, it seems there's a bug with the incest fetish. If one of your offspring doesn't have it and you force it on them with the kink potion, they don't seem to be willing to fuck afterwards. The game will still cite their purely familial love and won't be attracted to you.

	creating a new generic system for Body Part TFs based on Body Part + race
	like dogs having the option of either pointy or lopped ears

	: i was checking a item i found in a alleyway and when i backed out to continue moving i got the post-sex sence from dom'ing Brax dispite me being outside the police station.
	
	ok, two weird stuff: first, everytime i entered brax's fight, he said that candi gave me the pass again, even in the first time. Secondly, and this is more complex, i tried to brew a potion of submissiveness right after DIANA, the dominant harpy offers herself. Once back in the main story menu, it told me BRITTANY was worn out from sex and to go back to BRITTANY'S place, and lo and behold, the info in that section was the one of brittany instead of diana's. I had to move over the original brittany's place to get it back right.
	WOW, First Brax is not talking just about you, candy has a habit of giving out passes. As for the sexond one I am completely lost how that happened
	
	: Got a bug, i was in the arcade checking Nyan's specials menu then i clicked on section under her name to check her appearance and instead i got the apperance of my imported slave
	
	FINISH NEW KATE MENU & USE FOR SLAVE CUSTOMISATION
	Slave customisation
	able to change our tongue color
	
	Slave action inspect should give an affection gain if slave has exhibitionist fetish
	
	have big red text in the main menu if the java version being used is different from what the game was coded for
	
	It's kinda odd to see sub slaves forcing themselves on you when they have the "Use You" permission enabled. I believe it would be more realistic if they meekly ask you for sex, giving you options to be dominant or submissive partner or simply dismiss them.
	
	Thighfucking in the doggy style position, the 'cum on back' option was available. And I guess it reused the text from other things, because it mentions pulling out of a hole. ...Not really accurate for thighfucking.
	
	thigh sex NPCs will incessantly do it
	I get issues with constant tail and thigh sex
		[remake sex AI: assign weights to each action. Actions performed can alter weights.]
	
	also, with the changes to orgasms I had 96 arousal but when brax was the dominant partner I ended up not orgasming at all (The problem is that arousal that high should have triggered a simultanious orgasm)
	
	
	One crash to a previous scene after taking Lilanya's goggles from her lab. Exiting inventory, I was forced to an earlier fight, which then skipped to another sex scene. But the auto-save just before picking up the glasses was solid.
	NPCs on the street waste potions on you that won't work or don't give further TF. They should probably recognize that they're wasting +vagina potions on girls? Getting Furry TFs seems really hard to get to activate. (Which isn't bad, but waste potions is disappointing ^-^
	Only nitpick I'd have is that NPCs and locations are hard to track on the map. A mouse-over that listed unique location titles and who's there would make it; and pathing, please, I know it's hard... But it'd make moving around alot easier.
	
	Another weird thing: I used Diana's Perfume and got the transformation, and it said my natural feather color was 'black'. But then it reverted to 'red' when I took a selfie. It may be because I set my body color to red but shouldn't it have shown me that in the transformation text?
	
	
	
	Are NPCs supposed to spawn with snowflake jewelry out of season? Playing a save still in October, and NPCs are spawning with them.

Vicky sells essences, but won’t buy them. Ralph doesn’t sell them, but will buy them from you. This is probably wrong.

Most potions are named in the style of “Canine elixir of <whatever>”, or something similar. However, reindeer potions are simply named “Elixir of <whatever>”.

The demon transform menu is a bit inconsistent if you’re only part demon:
If your arms or legs aren’t demonic, you can’t edit them at all (and if they are, you can’t change them to anything else — what is that section even for?);
If your eyes aren’t demonic, you’re permitted to edit what your eyes would be if they were demonic, but this doesn’t affect your actual, non-demonic eyes;
For the rest of your body, you seem to be able to edit it freely even if it’s still human (or one of the furry types).

If you start a new game while in an existing one, any characters in the current cell get added to the new game’s contact list.

I met a brand new NPC in cell (0,0) and immediately knew the details of her cock and ass, before getting her naked. This is an update, I reported a similar case before and suggested it might be related to an import error, but this time was in a new game started in version 1.96.1, so not an import error.

Given how long the demon tail is described as being, you should really be able to tail-fuck or tail-peg a partner from any position, but some of them don’t allow you to. Seems to be the oral positions (doggy, kneeling, and 69) that are missing it.

The “Tease Clit” action disappears when you start fucking someone.

When you drink a stat boost potion (as opposed to a TF potion), the list of effects is printed out twice.

I’m guessing this one is a “WONTFIX”, but for completeness sake: When you start a new game with an imported character, in the intro sequence in the street, the catgirl says “He’s human” even if you aren’t. Even if you’re a full demon, they don’t react, and Lilaya still finds it surprising that you aren’t affected by the storm.
	
	
	
	
	If you finish with your character then go to the clothes section after.
		Supposing you gave your character piercings for their ears.
		Then you press the back option, and then enter the clothes selection again.
		You will see an extra pair of earrings in the inventory to the right.
		Its a repeatable bug that doesnt affect the game after you start, but i thought you would want to know?
		It may increase memory usage or something for all i know.
	
	jobs & repeatable side quests
	
	add a male virginity fetish, along with some NPCs spawning in with penile virginity
	
	While I'm at it, NPCs don't seem to have any kind of preference for body weight - would be nice if they did and adjusted body weight to suit their tastes when force TFing you. :)
	
	
	I'll add a way to reset each of the reindeer overseers (for if you don't like their generated fetishes). :3

I'll try and add in some way to deal with the overcrowding of Dominion's squares at some point.

I did consider adding ethnicities when I was first making the game, but decided to leave it up to the player's imagination. However, it would be valuable in making pre-set skin/hair/eye colours for randomly generated NPCs, as well as for helping to describe some of the races I have planned, so I might add ethnicity at some point. :3

I'll also add a way to change NPC's sexuality soon, as that seems to be a heavily-requested feature. :3
	
	add in strutter and leg lover
	
	add the "self-insemination" action to sex scenes soon (the one that used to be present in Brax's sex scene), so I'll get virgins with pregnancy/broodmother fetishes to use that
	
	Slaves without the “Exhibitionist” fetish should probably lose affection if you make them go naked.
	
	Likewise, alley encounters don’t react to storm conditions. Not such a big deal with muggers, since all they do is attack you anyway, but prostitutes probably shouldn’t still be working.
	
	
	I'll see about adding a small variation to NPC's levels when using a level-scaling difficulty (+/- 3 sounds good).
	
	There’s some sort of problem with the public stocks. The scenes are fine, but the first intro line (You decide to have some fun with the <Insert Race Here> in the stocks nearest you) is buggy. At first I thought it was just going off the first one regardless of which one you picked, but subsequently I realised it was more than that when it told me I was fucking a wolf-girl when there wasn’t a wolf-girl there.

Well, I say the scenes are fine, but they obviously need a lot more work; they use the same actions as the regular scenes, leading to such things as non-con slaves “trying to pull away from you, but you easily stop them”, or willing slaves masturbating despite being restrained.

I had completely explored the main Dominion area in 1.90, but some cells in the southwest were hidden again after import to 1.95. NPCs in them were still there, just the “explored” information was missing. This happened with two different saves, both lost some cells in the southwest.

I just met a trap, and despite never having seen her naked, I apparently just knew she was a trap and what her cock and ass look like. If it’s relevant, she was in one of the cells that was obfuscated on import.

NPCs with the “Transformer” fetish don’t respect gender content options. They don’t need to follow the same frequency or anything, but if I’ve completely disabled a body-type from being in the game, it might be an idea to filter it from NPC TF preferences too.
	
	have a button for Take All, Sell All in the inventory
	
	The slave management UI is not very good at the moment... x_x
I'll improve it as soon as I can! :3

I'll also definitely add bunk beds and other higher capacity room modifications.

I'll add an upgrade for stocks in the garden at some point too; good idea
	
other bug is that it say that brax and kate are pregnant with my children despite it not showing on there appearance page and they don't have the pregnant effect.

	
	I'm planning on adding a special orgasm denial action, which I'll then allow NPCs with the denial fetish to use (I might split up the fetish into 'being denied' and 'denying others' variants).
	
	i dunno if this is a bug,so here i go:i spawn some item to dress scarlet. 2 of the item are the weapon. i dress scarlet and pick up the weapon last. here is the thing: for some reason the weapon duplicate. when i pick them it was 8 of them stacked .i spawn the item in 1 of the slave room.
	
	When I next work on improving the slave UI, I'll see if I can add a "quick view" icon to the slave list, which you'll be able to hover over to see their status effects. :3
	
	
	I'll change it soon so that offspring will spawn in even without the incest option turned on (although no sex actions will turn up if incest is turned off). :3
	
	
	I might slightly tweak the ass+breasts transformations later on, as it does seem a little silly to need to grow furry breasts in order to gain access to the associated race's milk.
	
	
	Add 'Find new Overseer'
	
	FINISH NEW ORGASM ACTIONS
	
	
	The start tf menu is describing me as a succubus (Which was the last NPC I used this menu in)

	6:32] NoFratChicks: System.setProperty("prism.lcdtext", "false"); near-doubled the speed for me, so it does seem to be rendering related
	[06:34] NoFratChicks: Not sure what it does, renders text with greyscale rather than LCD subpixels? Anyway might be worth adding an option to turn that off, I'll tell you if I find something else that has a signficant effect. I'm sure there's something to disable general anti-aliasing that would help as well.
	[06:34] NoFratChicks: The 10 other people with this kind of setup will thank you :weary:
	[07:11] NoFratChicks: Removing the fade-in effect on tooltips has improved my experience, might be worth disabling that if the menu fade option is disabled, the same people are going to want tooltip fade off.

During arcane storm facing a random encounter on generic title and winning by dismissal, (just leave not using removal option), bug out the map and stop listening to mouse commands, keyboard still work and restore functionality after moving

Thigh sex, paizuri, butt jobs, and blowjobs shouldn't count for losing penile virginity.

Is there a bug where if you attempt to get a submissive partner to fuck you in the ass, they'll do thigh sex and not stop no matter what you do?  Or are the characters in my game just scared of buttholes?

Feline Fancy now open the enchanting screen for strength instead of intelligence as it should

 Contrary to my hopes and dreams, you cannot use your tail to penetrate as a gator. Hopefully this is a bug. (Magic ought to be able to add prehensibility(?)!)
	
	If i import my character, im stuck at the "survive the evening" quest.
	
A small problem I just noticed, I tried to enable 'Light Theme' out of curiosity and everything displayed badly, White buttons on a white background, a list of shortcut key vertically on the left. It seemed to be in mobile device display mode but still with white text on a white background, except for the shortcut key references.

	I'll add a way to change the date in the debug menu for the next release! ^^
	
The pullout thing is slightly bugged. In some cases, I've requested a pull-out, but then MC cums and it only gives the option to "Stay in position," which always results in a creampie. I will mention this is always during NC content.
	
Npc's are doing that black magic voodoo thing where they're pulling up my chemise from beneath my slip dress without pulling that up.

	tell the NPCs to stop being so obsessed with thigh sex for the next version
	
	 I discovered that if you accidentally make too many slaves have overlapping shifts at the stocks, the cell is full and you're unable to enter it.	
	 
	 give NPCs a small chance to spawn with addictive fluids for this next update
	
	Having the Denial Fetish should turn the 'Sexually Frustrated' penalty into a bonus of some sort
	
	Is initiating submissive sex raising corruption a bug
		submissive sex to alleyway attackers is still locked behind the submissive fetish
		
		
	Also on that note, the selfie screen then says you lost that virginity—including oral if you sucked your tail—to that partner instead of to yourself. Should sucking your tail even count as "giving head"?
	
	Having multiple tails only lets you occupy a single one. Same with more than two hands, you can only use two at a time.
	
	Lilaya and Kate can use your tail in their special sitting position, but you cannot make that decision yourself. To use your tail on them, I mean.
	The sitting position with Lilaya and Kate doesn't allow you to use your tail on them, even though they can use theirs on you. Doesn't matter if you're on top or bottom. Maybe they can use your tail, haven't seen it though.
	
	If the first option page is filled, the second page has the last item of the first page repeated and the entire page is missing tooltips.
	If there are too many options and some get thrown into a second page, that second page has no tooltips and the first option on the second page is the last option on the first page repeated.
	
	Long tongues cannot take any virginities.
	
	The Virgin Killer meme sweater, when pulled up, only exposes your butt and groin. But it hardly goes past your hips and is fairly loose, shouldn't you be able to pull it up much further?
	
	On a similar note, what about being able to pull down some of the sleeveless dresses (skater, plunge, slip and frontal zip, although that last one can be zipped anyway), like you can with the one-piece swimsuit and the bodysuit?
	
	Even the nursing bra gives you a penalty if you stain it with your own milk. Not an expert, but aren't they made to be fairly absorbent?
	
	
	I don't know if anyone else is getting this, but turning into an alligator made it impossible to open the selfie and status screens on the phone, as well the transformation text for some parts not showing up.
	
	Alligator Girls seem to be really bugged. Initiating Combat opens the inventory with the only way to continue being being to close it which results in you fleeing.
	 Interestingly enough you can open other combat 'Submenus' from the inventory screen if you click where the button would normally be located.
	  Also initiating sex with them and (immediately) ending it makes it impossible to continue. I tested it in both versions and it's broken in both.
	(Can confirm alligator morphs seem to break the game.)
	
	
	
	"you have fought her times"
	
	If you scroll down the room list menu and click to manage a room, the new menu remains scrolled down accordingly instead of being reset to the top of the menu.
	
	
	so, cant get slaves to have sex with each other again
	anyone doing anal on me is a last resort
	most npcs seem to go this way
	penis > vagina > oral > anal
	in order of what they are most likely to use. 
	
	It would be nice if instead of a set income from the stocks, there were tips that were randomish, just so there is a reason to use them without making a meta game out of it. 
	
	in my experiance right now it seems every time I request someone dont cum inside they dont. the only exception seems to be oral
	
	it would also be nice to be able to put slaves into a rotation seeing as it looks like future jobs may be more demanding and instead of run them into the ground it would be nice to set up a rotation. 
	
	I also ran into a bug where I put someone in stocks and that ended up makine the stocks time not work when I took them out of the stocks.
	
	
	
	
	
	Main char has wings that "are large enough that they can be used to allow you to fly", but "Fly after her" is disabled when Alexa heads off to give Scarlet a woopin' because I have no wings?
	
	Vicky will not buy arcane essences anymore, Ralph does now. 
	
	I'll extend the fix to reset hair lengths for all values out of normal ranges for versions prior to 0.1.95. :3
		It should also apply to random NPCs. :3
	
	 tail and horn sizes meant to be in the enchantment menu
	
	Got a bug, when i came across a incubus, fought and defeated him, i did the quick transform option, no penis, vagina and d-cup breast, and when sex started it said he was now a succubus and yet he had his dick back and lost his vagina. 

	Another bug when i went to meet brax for the first time, he acted like i met, fought and lost to him before despite it being the first time meeting him, the character i was playing as was imported from 1.89.2 to 1.90 then to this version so this might be a cause for this bug
	
	got another bug when i chose my sexual history as a trap i went with limited history it should of took my penile virginity but it didn't, tried moderate history and the same problem.
	
	
	
	
	Started a new game in 1.95, chose “very experienced”, Lilaya’s tests, “You’ll always remember this moment as the time that you lost your penile virginity!”.
	
	Importing a save exported from 1.89, the center panel appears but the side panels don’t. Needless to say, the game is not playable in this state.
	
	Tried out the new thigh sex, and it told me that my partner’s pre-cum lubricated their thighs. It obviously should have been my thighs (and status-effect-wise it was, it’s just the narration that was wrong).
	
	The new Paizuri dirty talk is for the be-cocked partner, but not for the boobèd one.
	Paizuri doesn’t have ongoing narration (pink italic text).
	Thigh sex doesn’t have ongoing narration or dirty talk.
	Hotdogging doesn’t have ongoing narration or dirty talk.
	
	When you’re fucking someone’s ass, and they come, it talks about their pussy squeezing down (if they have one), but not their ass. One would think that you’d be more likely to notice the one that you were actually in.
	
	My “Strengthened Aura” effect doesn’t seem to be affecting my willpower resist, at least according to the stat screen. It’s showing -70 from my “Frustrated” effect and my corruption, but that should be brought back up to -45 from the “Strengthened Aura”, which doesn’t appear to be the case.
	
	Weirdness:
	
	The “lacy plunge bra” and “lacy panties” don’t look particularly lacy to me.
	
	A black blazer is noticeably darker than other black clothing.
	
	I see a bunch of items geing generated with “+Stamina Damage” effect. Does this actually do anything? I don’t think I’ve come across any stamina damaging attacks so far.
	
	Lilaya makes such a big deal about your amazing aura after her “tests”, even going so far as saying you should warn any other demons you meet, yet none of these other demons seem to notice. OK, OK, maybe I just want to see the “lazy demon” get all hyper. I think that would be cute.
	
	
	idle slaves with house freedom be able to use or be used by other idle slaves or working slaves?
		Will it be possible to encounter slaves with outside freedom and get used by them in the alley ways
		
	
	I encountered a succubus, had my way with her after selecting preferences, then i clasped a slave collar onto her. she was sent to the slaver, but her and my stats on the right and left side remained. Also my and her items still remain visible. So it doesn't return you to the 'world view' screen after doing so
	
	missed the leg related fetishes for thigh sex preferences
		'Strutter' and 'leg lover' are my suggestions for kink names.
	
	could we move the 'to the stage' option in char creation from the 'check clothes' menu to the main menu
	
	
	missionary position + tribadism
	
	tongues be separate categories than faces
	
	I'm still getting importing bugs - both the enchanted gear bug and my perk points aren't being carried over
	
	Most of the time, when clicking on the "Fight!" button does nothing. After clicking on it, mousing over it again displays a message to the effect of "You can't do that while in combat!"
	(Save + relaod fixed it)
	
	Anyone else have issues during TF scenes where the process gets "stuck"? As in, it will keep trying to TF a body part that you already have, and the process won't progress anymore?
Currently, it seems that I cannot obtain non-human genitals from an NPC's TF scene
So, the game keeps getting stuck there, and I can't get TF'd any further than a gender swap (unless I get pregnant)

	: I exported my game and got extra 25 global resist + others
	[clothing export bug?]
	
	there seems to be a glitch for, at least my, imported char where Brax attacks me when i meet him for the first time
	
	Tattoos and slave customisation at Kate's place
	
	
	I encountered a succubus, had my way with her after selecting preferences, then i clasped a slave collar onto her. she was sent to the slaver, but her and my stats on the right and left side remained. Also my and her items still remain visible. So it doesn't return you to the 'world view' screen after doing so
	had a saved game right after defeating her, so i loaded that up, no sex this time, clasped slave collar and no problem. I'll see if I can try and get it to act up again.
[05:52] GrimWaltz: I've narrowed the problem down. It seems that after choosing having sex with the succubus after defeating her and turning her into a slave, the game gets the problem. If you don't have sex with her but turn her into a slave there's no problem.
[05:57] GrimWaltz: Also there's a minor problem with removing the condom when you're having sex. When you click on the condom and then choose "discard", it seemingly does nothing, but after closing the inventory the condom will be removed, but you won't have a "discard" message like you normally would but checking your clothing menu you will see it has been removed. (this was present in the previous version as well)
	
	satisfying a slave's addiction should raise their affection
	
	is the unwilling fucktoy fetish supposed to make NPCs resist?
		Because I gave it to a slave and she only sometimes resists
	
	day 0, I go outside (on the storm) got attacked by a cow girl, non consensual activated, maximum dficulty, I got smached, but on the sex, the ask to be freed give the dirty talk description onhover (but give the good acction)
	
	
	
	
	
	------------
	
	There's no skin color preference settings? Skin color preference settings when?
	
	Slaves still aren't interacting correctly outside of work/between jobs.
	
	Move urethral stuff to generic genitals
	
	[Possibly caused by buyback handling?]
	- several places the game just hung on me, for example
		1. visited Nyan's Clothing Store. I had a dress of unknown features, so I put it on, it had some minor effect, so I sold it and the other clothing items
		2. visited another store, entered and clicked the 'Trade with ...' button and nothing. Tried another store and the same, also if I returned to Nyan's shop reloaded from a save.
	- a few other times it just hung but I am not sure of any clear pattern to report, I get the general feel it is related to items in some way but not sure
	
	Freezing in Finch's screen (after getting slaver license)
	
	When your partner is about the cum the 'Prepare' button seems odd, and it resets what tab as such you are on so you have to re-select 'Sex Actions' or similar to resume.
	
	every so often when i try to enter a store or a sex scene the menu and description wont change
	
	I'll be working on adding knotting descriptions & actions this week! :3
	I'm also going to be reworking the race detection system, which will allow for proper detection of hybrid races.
	
	I'll add more 'Dark Alleyway' tiles for succubi/incubi too. :3
	
	------------
	
	
	get cloacas working
	
	Apparently, it doesn't like it when you ride the 19 inch succubi cock analy like a slut, tail peg her ass, and finger her pussy.. at the same time
	
	Sex work:	
	
	- go through positioning actions and check conditions
	
	- Improve orgasm dialogue.
		- Add in position-specific orgasm scenes.
		- Add in body-part recognition for orgasm scenes. Things such as knotting, orifice modifiers, fluid modifiers, etc.
	
	- Add in missing content related to the new transformations. Addictive fluids, part modifiers referenced during sex, etc.
	
	- Add thigh sex.
	
	- Add more slave jobs.
		Assisting Rose
		gardener
	Improve slave events
	
	- Add more ways to influence a slave's affection and obedience.
		More room items
	
	
	
	
	
	Add Amber repeat action (fence has arcane barrier now)
	
	
	
	----------
	
		When buying Scarlett, maybe add a third option for players who aren’t that keen on owning a slave but don’t want to just eat the ¤2500 they spent, so offer that you’ll free her if she works it off. She’d presumably start out hating you less, and being less unruly, with a big hit later if you decide to screw her over down the line.
	
		In a scene, when an NPC rubs their crotch through their clothes, maybe it shouldn’t tell you that a trap or shemale is rubbing their cock if you haven’t seen it before, just say “crotch”?
		
		Speaking of which, how come we can grope our own crotch, but not an NPC’s?
		
		Bug Reports:
		
		I know it’s on the radar already, but I thought it worth a reminder that there is basically no lesbian option for the chair scene Lilaya and Kate use.
		
		Speaking of Lilaya, I just had a scene with her where she kept on using her tail on herself, I kept pulling it out and she immediately reinserted it, Every. Single. Time. Something like a couple dozen times in a row. And because you’re technically still the submissive partner in that scene even if you turn things around, you can’t forbid her from doing this.
		
		I think I found a bug with an encounter with an NPC with the “Unwilling Fuck-toy” fetish. She was ambiphillic, so her resisting should have been an act, but her arousal obviously had the large penalty an NPC gets when they really don’t want you fucking them, as it kept dropping to zero. This might have had something to do with her being a slave in the stocks; maybe that uses the wrong “resisting” scene, the real one, by mistake?
		
		Penises are regaining their virginity on export/import. Well… sort of. They show as virgin on the selfie screen, and are described as virgin when exposed, but using one doesn’t count as losing/taking virginity. This affects NPCs as well as the player.
		
		Imported potions have proper backgrounds now, but they still don’t stack with newly brewed ones, even when they have identical effects. Given the limited number of inventory slots, this is something of an issue.
		
		I’m not sure why ankle boots are listed as feminine; they look pretty neutral to me. Likewise with the headband, which is listed as neutral despite looking obviously feminine.
		
		When switching to doggy style, PC’s line (“Be a good girl and hold still while I fuck you like the bitch you are!”) fits in fine with the dirty talk from the “Rough” pace, but seems rather out of place if you’re in the “Gentle” pace.
		
		Kate’s intro says she has plump lips and wavy hair, but she actually has full lips and a bob cut. Also says she has three pairs of breasts even if your settings limit her to one pair.
		
		Looking back on things, I’m pretty sure every feminine NPC I’ve met has had “full” sized lips, they never seem to have larger or smaller ones.
		
		Found a bug with the character generation screen; I went to start a new game (from within a running game, not a new session) and when I went to change body style (that is, skinny-huge and soft-ripped) the result body type stayed fixed at “Average”, not changing like it should. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to reproduce it, and there was nothing in the error log, so this report probably isn’t going to be useful; I include it simply so you know there’s a possible issue there.
	
	
	-----------
	
	
	Bugs:
	
	----------------
	
	1. After trying to impregnate Lilaya when fighting an enemy my games freezing (I found out that this is because you impregnate her so get your D out of her before you defeating some enemy)
	For your information the save files that I used is from 0.1.90 so I think there's no problem in exporting and importing files within the version
	
	After the first sex scene with Lilaya, the game just stopped working. I can't progress /  resume play at all
	--------------
	
	Here's a five minute fix for the NPC AI. Currently, if the player has an accessible vagina, dominant npcs never go for the butt unless they have an anal fetish. Why not add the "rough" npc fetishes to that as well? Eg: dominant, sadist, and rapist npcs might also have a chance to target the ass instead of the pussy.
	Also, consider having the NPC take the PC's fetishes into account when deciding actions instead of just their own. I could see a submissive NPC trying to please their partner by doing what they like. This would add a whole lot of complexity to your AI system though, so it might be infeasible to add that to your system, as it is now, without risking breaking things.
	
	Fingering with gloves equipped? Right now they block fingers which I believe is both true and false at the same time: We might not be able to equip rings and such, but i believe we can push gloved fingers into an orifice.
	
	urethra pen
	
	I'm also getting bug where equipment stat changes do not carry over correctly during exporting 
	
	Just FYI that pregnancy stats continues to be broken on imported characters.
	
	Exporter/Importer broke. Can't import files, even unmooded ones.
	
	There also seems to be a bug with the slavery system's economy.  If you start a new game some of your debt from the previous character carries over to the new one.
	
	"before roughly bobbing your head up and down into your groin" should be "as you remind her who's in charge, before roughly bobbing your head up and down into her/his groin."
	
	
	It seems exported characters have issues with offsprings.  My exported character was unable to access the pregnancy reports page.
	
	I don't know how, but I can't open my slaves' inventories from the slave overview page. The backpacks are greyed out but it gives a generic description like nothing's stopping it.
Edit: Wouldn't let me open my own inv either. Exiting the process then opening a new one stops it though.
	
	
	
	Check the slavery jobs. If you give a slave a 24 hour work shift, it breaks the night/day cycle for some reason.  The dialogue options stay grayed out for all the slaves no matter how many times you rest.
	
	
	I don't know if this is a bug or intentional but i cant seem to actually release Arthur. After the fight i try to release him and it just gets stuck and i cant go any farther but it wont let me leave the screen. 
	
	
	"Bug" report: During the import process (for both game and NPC imports as far as I have noticed), the game forcefully sets the preferred body type to be an exact copy of the imported NPCs, rather than keeping any previous preferences from the old save.
	 This results in any imported NPCs simply transforming you into themselves, limits and content permitting.
		The reason seems to be that the body preference is set from the actual body parameters of the NPC, rather than getting it from the specified "preferredBody" element created during the export process when it is imported.
	
	
	Could we get a "drop all inventory" feature? Or at least a better storage area? Different color clothing and potions clog up inventory space fast
	
	
	I enslaved one of my daughters and now all of my slaves are calling me mom. The rename button does nothing.
	
	
	"affection apparently works, but every single slave isn't gaining obedience anymore"
	
	Lactation content
	
	merge alligators
	
	[You are about to cum / your partner is about to cum / both of you are about to cum] [You cum from x body part] [Your partner cums from y body part] [if applicable, fluids go to place z] [after orgasm texts for you, such as noting taste of cum or risks of pregnancy] [after orgasm texts for partner]
	
	 I was going to prevent orgasms unless direct stimulation is being performed, so maybe I could use the oral fetish to bypass that (allowing oral fetishists to orgasm just by performing oral) 
	
	
	Started a new male char, chose experienced for sexual history, Started with Zero corruption. After doing Lilaya for her first set of 'tests' This is wgat it said in my selfie:"You lost your penile virginity to your first girlfriend. You lost your penile virginity to Lilaya in Lilaya's lab."
	
	on the stats, pregnancy stats are not showing at all
	
	Save games that are exported from 189.2 and 190 lose a few things, such as
-Slave activity log
-Flames in the slave account balance
-Player and NPCs regain their penile virginity
-The attributes of NPC genitalia and private parts is forgotten by the player. You have to get them naked again in order to know their dick size and whatnot.
	
	
	: I noticed a few situations where dominant female npcs would attempt to ride on a female PC even though there's nothing there to ride one. It seems that the AI doesn't know what to do when neither character has a penis. For the time being, consider making the NPC prefer oral sex for F/F pairs instead of moving the character into positions where there is only foreplay options like fingering/kissing, etc.
[04:44] Tukaima: Managed to get that thing to happen again. Encountered a dog-girl during a storm, and once I enslaved her, the text showed "Savannah", but in the slave list she's actually named "dog-girl". Reproduced it two more times after that, twice in front of Lil's house, and another time in an empty cell.
[07:15] the sarssol: seems like imported slaves default to using their own name to refer to you
	
	
	
	
	
	
	[Might already be fixed]
	I've seen this issue reported on an older version but i've just discovered it's still happening, after importing from 1.89.2 to 1.9.0 all of my characters modifier's from clothing (+ 4 will power damage, + 4 global resist, + 35 fertility etc.) are no longer applying bonuses. Because I am wearing the clothing however when i remove it i gain a minus modifier of the same value (- 4 willpower damage, - 4 global resist, -35 fertility etc.). This has essentially crippled my character by giving them massive reductions to willpower damage and global resist which are the stats I hunted for on my gear. :(
	
	
	
	All slave rooms reset to base upon import from 1.89.2. They are still classified as slave rooms with he right slaves in them but they have been emptied of all extra's like beds, room service and obedience trainers.

	Maybe also a suggestion/request?
	Please could creampie duration scale with dosage of cum and last even longer with effects like viscous and sticky?
	
	Oh an also for some reason all of my test subjects that get experimented on are reporting that Lilaya did some intrusive experiments on the last viewed slave. It lists the correct slave in the 'Slave' field but incorrectly lists whichever slave I was in the same room with as the test subject in each transformation.
	
	
	
	I haven't set NPCs to be able to spawn with addictive cum just yet, but I'll do that as soon as I can! (It will be a random chance.) :3
	
	Slave sex: ------
	
	made one cumdump in each profession
no one touched them
allowed one to masterbate
she never did and has been pent up for days.

I also made sure that every character that spawns has both sets.
	
	Additionally I'd like to re-report that slaves are not interacting consistantly. Slaves do not interact AT ALL during free time (at least if they have jobs). Slaves with jobs only interact with other slaves on the same job during the hours they work together. I was able to get ALL of my slaves interacting and doing stuff by switching them all to the maid job with the same hours. They continued to do NOTHING duirng free time though. They ALL have the free roam mansion and outside mansion permissions.

Finally importing from 1.89.2 reset my slaves cleanliness permissions. Test subjects must keep their creampies, for science!
	
	
	I'll make some tweaks to the code to allow slaves with the 'masturbate' setting enabled to engage in using you as well. :3
	
	
	Ok, every slave is set to 
	house freedom
	use you
	3 meals 
	maintain
	wash clothing
	
	all the slaves but 1 has slave stud
	2 of them have breeding bitch and sex toy
	
	All of them have off at the same times, at least the ones that aren't experiment 24/7 slaves
	
	one is only attracted to masculan
	one is attracted to everything. 
	
	Pass 30 days, and neither are pregnant, in an entire house of futas, all should be pent the hell up bad. 
	
	I waited 2 months, still no mention of pregnancy or even an encounter. 
	
	
	I've just been testing this,
	All of my slaves have permission to free roam in and outside house. Of my 2 slaves who are sex toys only one gets used. The one that keeps getting used is working in the kitchen, and the only person using her (despite all my slaves having permission) is the one working in the kitchen with them, always with the 'X saw X go into the pantry alone and couldn't help but fuck follow them in and fuck them'. So currently for slaves to be able to sex eachother it seems they have to be working the same job at the same time and that they wont interact in their free time.
	
	All of my slaves have permission to use sex toy but not to masturbate and all have been frustrated for 20 days now without any use of the available sex toys.
	
	I've been doing this for 20 in-game days and it'sthe same result over and over.
	
	Also when my virgin slave lost her virginity it doesn't update the appearance screen with that information. It also says on her pregnancy record that she was impregnated by X and gave birth to X 0 days later, despite me allowing this to occur naturally.
	
	(i accidentally posted this message to the wrong chain further down, sorry)
	
	Additionally slave's giving birth/having sex with gigantic penises doesn't increase their capacity when plasticity is high.
	
	(i extended the above test to 3 in game months and am still producing the same results)
	
	not able to repeat this, my slaves aren't touching each other at all.
	going to try a new save in a new install area so nothing is contaminated.
	
	In the new instance of the game, I was able to get 2 of the 4 non breeder slaves in an area to have sex... granted the slave they were having sex with was not attracted so its basicly rape, and the other work room where everyone was attractive to each other won't touch each other.
	
	
	
	Current bug After finding a fugitive (I've only found females so far):
When enslaving them, their name will be whatever they spawned in as. IE ("the wolf girl" is her name) 
when trying to change it, there's no way to do so. Typing in a name causes you to navigate through your menu options, even though you're typing in the name box. Also, hitting the check mark to lock her name in, just resets it back to the default.
	
	
	Are submissive NPCs supposed to be able to stop you fingering yourself?

Men's trousers can only be black or white.

Gynephilic causes you to deal half willpower damage to males. That's not what the description says it does.

Importing a save directly from 1.89.2 to 1.90.5 is broken. The game loads, but the sidebars don't render, just the center panel. Error log here. Importing to 1.90 then exporting again works as a workaround.
	[at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)
    at com.lilithsthrone.game.Game.importGame(Game.java:493)]

Imported potions are different to newly enchanted ones. They don't stack with them and they have the word "null" instead of the pentagram background image.

Once Kate's tail is in your ass, there's no way to get it out again.

A girl with the virginity fetish probably shouldn't ask you to fuck her, however if you use the "Tease her pussy" action, she will.
	
	----
	
	Exporting and importing a game causes characters' transformation preferences to change. For example someone who wanted to turn you into a girl may now want to give you a penis.
	
	Urethral actions
	
	
	There seems to be a bug in the save compatibility, which is manifesting in an error when trying to inspect some slaves. I'll try and figure out what's going wrong as soon as I can! :3
	
	
	if you edit an npc's preferred body type, it doesn't stick, probably because editting an npc makes the game act like you never met them, so you go through their introduction all over again, and probably resetting their preferred body type to whatever it was previously.
	
	If you're having trouble tracking down the memory leak, repeated load actions and inventory views very rapidly accelerate it. After a while the UI becomes so unresponsive that you'll be waiting up to a second or two for some actions to complete.
	
	re Succubi bugged at the moment?  They say they wont let you use their pussy when they take their cock out, but during sex they only kiss, masturbate themselves, and do vaginal sex.  They never actually use their cock.  They also only use the back to wall position.
	I have a Succubus slave and when I let her be the dominant one she always does the same thing over and over. That being the back to wall position and never switch to anything else. I have tried to give her different fetishes to see if that does anything but no luck.
	
	I've also noticed problems with other npcs. All human male NPCs, for example, only use the same 3 positions: Doggy performing oral, kneeling performing oral, and kneeling recieving oral.  Thats all. :frowning:(edited)
		It may be the same with all masculine NPCs but I haven't tested enough
		I just want an NPC to forcefully break-in my character but no one will do it

	Not sure if it's a bug or not, but after you've infiltrated Zaranix's home and retrieved Arthur (with the 'fly over fence' option), you can't knock anymore, regardless of whether or not you actually fought anyone. Can still fly over the fence, tho.

	Bugs
-Talking to someone in a room will always have the dialogue written as if you're talking to the first person listed in the room.

-When you ask about a slave's background they sometimes respond with:
Slave smiles as you ask her about her past life, and responds, "Hello Player! How are you? Is there anything I can do for you?"

At first I thought that this might be a bug with a specific personality, but I've gotten it from slaves with different personalities. I can't really figure out a pattern with it.

After further testing, I'm starting to notice a pattern with the slave's response about their background. I think it has something to do with the slave's affection towards the player. All the bugged lines seem to be coming from slaves that have an affection rating of 30 or higher - or wherever it is the Affection level becomes 'likes'.

If their affection is above 30 the slave's response is usually the same line that they greeted you with.

when the text dialogue starts with
As you approach Slave, she looks up at you, a huge smile breaking out across her face as she joyously calls out, "Hello Player! Is there anything I can do for you?"
Their response is
Clearly happy at being asked about her past life, Slave quickly responds, "Hello Player! Is there anything I can do for you?"

If their greeting is
As you approach Slave, she looks up at you, a huge smile breaking out across her face as she joyously calls out, Hello Player! How are you? Is there anything I can do for you?
their response about their background is
Slave smiles as you ask her about her past life, and responds, Hello Player! How are you? Is there anything I can do for you?

if the slave has the bimbo fetish, the lines can be slightly different. Like greeting you with "Hello Player! Is there anything, like, I can, um, do for you?" and the answer about their background being "Hello Player! Is there, like, anything I can do, like, for you?"

it also happens if they greet you with the pregnancy dialogue. Their response can be either the "... How are you? Is there anything..." or "Hello Player! Is there anything..." line.

I haven't received a bugged line from a slave that has an affection rating of 24 or lower.

	add in "doggy-style receiving oral" for victory scenes asap
	
	
	---------------
	SEX AI:
	
	or example, 9 times out of 10 when both the PC and NPC are female, and you submit to the NPC, all the NPC does is randomly stick her fingers in and out of her pussy and ass, then she usually just cums without anything else happening. Here's how it almost always goes (and this is regardless of NPC fetishes):

	1. NPC exposes her pussy and yours.
	2. NPC either sticks her fingers in your pussy or hers for a round or two, then pulls them out.
	3. NPC will usually switch positions, then does the same thing till she cums. Most of the time, her fingers are not even in her pussy.
	
	Basically, it's like the dominant female NPC doesn't want to cum from anything other than random masturbation. I'm not a lesbian so I don't know if this is how real lesbian sex works, lol.
	
	Submissive sex with dom male NPCs is usually okay, but every once in a while I'll get a guy who would rather finger his own ass than do anything else.
	
	A lot of times the NPC will switch positions the very turn before they cum. So if you're submissively sucking off a male NPC, he might switch to 69 with you on bottom, and then he ends up cumming on the ground. It's annoying.
	
	---------------
	
	
	
	Anyway, in this release (and the last preview, too, but I figured it was buggy and not worth commenting on), the sex options with Lilaya and Kate are really thin. It's possible that they always were and I just didn't notice, but at the least the hand-to-genitals options should be there. Chair oral sex (giving and receiving) would also be welcome, but I can live without them for a good while.

Also, the option to stop furry tail penetrations doesn't seem to stop demons from penetrating themselves with their tails. I'd like of like the options to just stop all non-player initiated tail penetration.

I've found that if you strip someone before sex, take all of their stuff, then have sex, they will have a new inventory of items at the end that you can also loot.
	
	
	
	When you Molest a slave who enjoys it and has max affection they still say "I am yours to use mistress" and it says they did so coldly
	
	
	
	I will try and get an 'Auto-equip clothing after sex' option added for this next version! ^^
	
	
	Suggestion for improvement of "Denial" fetish: The Denial fetish in it's current form kind of sucks, to be frank. IMO what it should do instead is add an extra reaction option when a submissive cums to prevent them from doing so, as Pix does in her scene. The submissive should then start begging to be allowed to cum, getting increasingly more frantic the more times they are denied.
	
	Suggestion for counterpart to "Denial" fetish: Denial is one of the orgasm control fetishes; the other is forced orgasms. If you make a submissive cum several times, they should start begging you to stop making them cum, getting increasingly more frantic the more times you do.
	
	Suggestion for "Non-Con" fetish: When the submissive's arousal gets high, they should beg you specifically not to make them cum, rather than the more general "stop doing that to me" dialog.
	
	
	If you set furries to be on but leave the forced racial transformations as human only, you do not get any genitalia added during the transformations. So you ultimately end up as a "doll."
		Hmm... I thought it had broken my save game, but it seems to break the properties file. So, that's good. I'll just have to endure all the encyclopedia entries again, lol.
	
	
	
	I will definitely add a way to apply potions to all of your slaves (as well as adding in an action to get your succubi slaves to self-transform). There are definitely quite a few improvements I can make to the slave system, and I'll try and get them all done as soon as I can! ^^
	
	I will also add a recipe book to save potions to, as well as the ability to name them. Good suggestions! ^^
	
	
	
	
	Zaranix finishing touches

	TODO
		Moved the sometimes-hard-to-read flashing message at the bottom of the screen (which was used for things like 'Quicksaved!') into the event log.
	
	When being submissive, your partner will sometimes ask you to pull out, but the only option available is "Stay in Position"
	
	chastity belt to say it blocks penis
	
	Exporter's (Game Export) doing something funky with Fertility/Virility. Seems if you have an item that buffs or nerfs either of those stats, the exporter applies the opposite to your character. This makes it so after importing, you character will have the same stats as if the item was unequipped, but while it's still equipped, and once removed it alters your stats opposite of the item's stats.
Say a character starts with 25 Fertility. Equipping the Breeder collar adds 50, bringing you up to 75. Export the game and re-import the same file and your Fertility is back at 25 but with the collar still equipped. Remove the collar and your Fertility drops to -25. I've so far found this bug affects Virility as well by using gear I modded to apply a Fertility buff.
A good work around seems to be to unequip all items that change these stats before exporting, then re-equipping them after importing, which seems to allow stats to behave as expected. So far it's just with file exporting/importing (pretty both character and game files), so saves are fine.
In fact, it seems this is happening to ANY stat buff/nerf offered by equipment. So far tested on equipment offering buffs to Physical Damage, Willpower Damage, and Willpower Resistance.
	
	
	Ran into a girl wearing a chemise and pantyhose. Can't pull up chemise, it's blocked by pantyhose; can't pull down pantyhose, it's blocked by chemise. WTF?

Number 1 item action for equipped items is always "drop". It should be the same as items in inventory (So when talking to a shopkeeper, "Sell", and when looking at a defeated enemy "Take").

Displacing a bikini describes it as "pulling it down", which sounds wrong to me. Wouldn't pulling it up be easier?

Submitted to a succubus, she called my PCs large DD breasts "tiny little things, how cute!", despite hers also being DDs.

	can't seem to view the pregnancy tab and not sure if implemented yet, but slaves won't fuck each other.

	Seeing some odd behavior above day 100 in _0_1_89_2 where if you rest, time no longer advances as expected (and interactions that are limited to daily do not reset).   Have save files if needed.
	
	 they start in SMSubStanding() and then just stay there
	 
	 It seems slaves just won't have anal sex with my character
		they just push him against a wall and kiss him until they cum
		actually, this seems to be the case with all succubi, rather than just slaves
		
		
	Okay, I think I'm getting closer to an answer on this one. SLAVE_USES_YOU (the sexResponse type that generates the sex encounter) uses the SMSubStanding() sexManager, which starts in the standing position with SUB_NORMAL pace for PC and Sex.getPartner().getSexPaceDomPreference() for the NPC. I'm guessing that something about that dom preference is what's causing it to get stuck in Standing despite the code showing that position options for the scene are generic.
	 Hm, well after looking a bit deeper I think this could be fixed by Innoxia tweaking priorities similar to how it's done in unique NPC scenes. Not sure what it is about this scene that makes slaves indecisive (since I can't actually figure out where the code doing the "deciding" is)

	bulk application of slave effects
	
	Alexa's Slave Menu is still frozen as of 0.1.89.2: Frozen as in none of the symbols (inspect, buy) are clickable and the slave list doesn't refresh like it did in 0.1.88.5
	Alexa's slave display is still broken on imported games and old save files. It only updates correctly on new save games and imported characters. This is for the second hotfix.
	also unable to view Alexa's description in slaver alley after she gets her first batch of slaves to sell.  It's viewable when you first get back to finish Scarlett's quest, but something breaks it when you visit the next day
	
	
	
	Weirdness
	It's pretty weird that the descriptions for the stat "Fitness" are all about flexibility. What it actually does is in line with what I'd expect "Fitness" to do, but the flavour text is all about flexibility.
	Tried out a harpy transformation, got told "You now have avian breasts and nipples, and when lactating, you will produce avian milk". Something about that sounds wrong…
	
	
	
	any chance of an option that lets NPCs fully transform you in one go after losing to them in battle? Either a toggle or a combination of fetishes on the player side (so it works with any NPC, not just ones where you've given them the right combination of fetishes)?
	
	move the effects over to an alchemist perk, and then I'll think up of some sex-related effects for the transformer fetish
	
	You were impregnated twice and you gave birth but it still says you're pregnant
	A daughter just attacked me
	
	Total children 0, but had 3 daughters
	
	slave events are parsing the wrong person
	
	When exporting either a character or game the hair value of all characters are changed to 1 or 9. After exporting a second time all hair values previously set to 1 change to 0(they only seem to drop from 1 to 0 on the second export; an initial value of 1 will stay at 1 the first export).
	got a bug my character became bald and regained their penile virginity when i imported from 1.89.1 to 1.89.2
	
	After going through the game for awhile I finally figured out how to get a slave so when I actually go up to one of my slaves the game freezes on me and doesn't allow me to exit the slave management screen
	
	In "Face to wall" position, if the submissive one has a cock they should really cum on the wall, not the floor.

	Also, on the lower settings of the forced TF racial limits player genitals are taken away, but new ones aren't added, which I don't think is intended behaviour.
	
	In chair sex, "Kiss" action doesn't require mouths to be available.
	
	Bree and Brandi are sometimes called "him" during sex.
	
	When asking Lilaya about essences, the PC speaks about how "A piece of someone's essence broke off and shot into me", but you don't have to have actually seen this, since that conversation is now unlocked by Lilaya's "Tests".
	
	When using transformative on a slave in Slavery Administration some transformation descriptions mention Finch instead of target npc.
	
	Having 6/7+ (definately 7+) used condoms in inventory (with or without condom belt) and then talking with Ralph locks you into his intro, the only option that works is 'discount' and then that locks there without being able to refuse or proceed.
	
	big lag when it comes to buying and selling items en mass
	
	perhaps the affection gain from being lilaya's test subject with the tf fetish should be toned down a little? As is making them work double shift or all day actually massively increases their affection
	Maybe have it just be +0.1, and make it so that working more than 16hrs a day doubles the 'overworked' affection loss
	
	after an event in the city where you fight if you go into your bag and exit out it goes back to the last event encounter
	
	Offspring not getting deleted in the removeNPC in pregnancy
	TEST REMOVAL (check where affection is applied, or perhaps save bodies and generate NPCs later?)
	
	got a bug, when i unequip my rainbow gloves and stockings i get a -6 bonuses and when equiped i get no bonuses but goes to what it should be without the rainbow gear

	just found a another bug brax acted like we met before in his office when we haven't. candi and the gaurd that checks your pass acted like they should.
	
	I've had an issue spanning multiple versions with the "stop partner" command (and now the new "stop penetrations"). When a partner is penetrating themselves with their tail, choosing those options results in them immediately re-penetrating themselves in the same or a different orifice, over and over, as many times as you choose the option. Makes it impossible for you to do anything with their tail once it's started.
It's most noticeable with Lilaya an the other succubi, but it can happen with anyone if furry tail penetrations is on.
	
	Also, seems like if I have a male character, biology-wise, with femininity at or above 40, I get this in the description, "Your cock is concealed, so, due to your androgynous appearance, everyone assumes that you're a tomboy on first glance." Doesn't really make sense as that should mean I have a vagina which I don't and no penis which I do. Further testing showed it's at least correctly matching the assumption about the presence or lack of a feminine chest.
	
	Bug: player orgasm related actions 'Stay in position' and 'pull out' appear in the repeat actions menu when in the face-to-face position.
	
	The game refuses to let me actually take action.  I'm currently in the entering stage of a fight, but clicking the "fight" button does nothing
	
	the bug that spawns the kids before they are born is still happening (maybe)
	
	when revealing an NPC's chest it always uses male pronouns and refers to them as pecs regardless of circumstace.
	
	You regain spent skill points and fetish points(arcane essence) when importing a character while retaining old perks.
	
	I spammed the "Rest until Evening / Rest until Morning" button in my room and not only does the clock stop changing to show the correct time but the map also bugs out and does not show any movement at all.
	
	I spammed the "Rest until Evening / Rest until Morning" button to try to speed up my slave training but it appears to bug the map where if you move the map does not update and never moves even if you move past the edge.
	
	Mostly a display-issue, if you go from the hair section in Kate's shop to the actual shop part and back, the options at the bottom become part of the scrolling area
	
	child encounter frequency option along with the furry preferences list
	
	sleeping kinda bugged. visually.
	i am stuck in sex for deny?? when i'm about to climax
	another test i stuck at climax 5?
	
	Can resisting sex with random alleyway npc's be a thing again. The only time I can resist sex is with Brax, slaves with the "use you" permission and I think(?) the succubus in the dark alleyway. With the submissive non-con fetish being a thing now I would love more opportunities to use it.
	
	The books and your encyclopedia are saved to the "properties" file within the data folder which isn't attached to your actual save file. (Change?)
		I like the Encyclopedia being there, (Since it tracks what I've witnessed in ANY save) but the books/knowledge should probably be save-specific.
	
	One Bug that seems to have appeared is in the character creation menu.
	 When you are selecting your level of sexual experience, if your have a penis no matter what you pick it says that you are a virgin.
	  I think this might have something to do with the penis virginity section as when you select max sexual experience it does say that you have lost your mouth virginity, just not your genitals' virginity.
	   When you have a vagina, it does give your virginity's status, but if you are bi then it says you lost your virginity to a guy in a club's restroom and a your first girlfriend on two separate lines {I'm pretty sure you can only lose your virginity once :) }.
	
	I noticed a problem with strings that get cut off after certain characters. For instance, when you want to name a room "Scarlett's Room" (which is, IMO, not such an unusual way to name a room), everything after the apostrophe will be cut off and the room is now simply named "Scarlett". Same thing happens with savegame names.
	
	- I will try to make the sex system a little smoother in future; including adding little 'displace/remove' buttons to the clothing icons (you can strip them all in one go using the 'Unequip all (them)' action int eh inventory). ^^
- I'll add the ability to shift your body parts while a demon soon! :3
- The 'too loose' effect is only meant to be in effect if your penis is quite a bit smaller than the orifice's capacity. I'll take another look at their starting values. :3
- I will definitely add latex clothing and an associated fetish later on! ^^
- I'll add tooltips to the minimap as well; good idea! :3
	
	Chair Sex:
	- Submissive & rough talk options aren't associated with submissive & dominant fetishes.
	- No option to finger partner.
	- No option to get pussy stuffed with tail.
	
	Ralph's Discount:
	- Ralph probably shouldn't strip off the player's clothes.
	
	
	1) Brax doesn't know how to handle a gal in a chastity belt if he wins. I had one on to protect my precious virginity and he just kind of hung out instead of doing anything. 

	2) Submitting to other characters (again in a chastity belt) seems to not result in anal, pretty much at all. It doesn't appear in the sex options for a lot of the positions as the dominant partner, either. That may be working as intended, but I can't quite tell.
	
	Perhaps Lusty maidens shouldn't beg to have thier vaginal virginity taken? That derived fetish seems like they'd be more likely to beg to have their other holes used instead.
	
	While the button indicates it would return the flames originally spent when purchasing a room upgrade, it instead removes the same amount once more. This is especially problematic with crazy expensive things like the obedience trainer
	
	Use tabs for slavery
	
	Forced transformations should avoid transforming the type of your genitalia with that preference selected, but they *should* be transforming your genitalia's non-racial properties. I'll look into this and make sure it's working properly, thank you for the report! ^^
	
	
	Make Rose's scenes match her personality
	Update Lilaya scene
	Add Lilaya content for each stage of main quest
	
	Displace/remove clothing in sex as a single button on clothing
	
	one other thing i noticed not on that list, in previous versions, when i got to 80-100 arousal in sex, partners would nearly always tell me if they wanted me to cum inside or out.
	 in this version, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, but it's a lot less common. 
	not saying i care much whether they do or not, mainly asking if this is intentional or not.
	
	
	I noticed that when transforming nipples into nipple-cunts they are acknowledged in text, but there's no way to finger them/have them penetrated in sex actions
	
	Could we also get a bit more special dialogue for incestuous sex? After incestuous sex starts they sound just the same as sex with ordinary npc's, pet name calling from children and mentions of their relationship as child and parent could be enough.
	
	NPCs still use finger-in-mouth somehow...
	
	: Transformation Test Subject should probably reverse or at least lessen the affection loss towards Lilaya. Currently, it's just the normal -5 affection to Lilaya with each session regardless of whether or not a slave has said fetish
	
	add in manual font selection
	
	Left: map
	Right: characters present, slavery manager, copy dialogue, save/load indication, menu
	
	add the ability to strip enchantments when I add in clothing enchantment mechanics 
	
	I haven't had any encounters/interactions with offspring either (in any version of the game), even with the Incest option turned on.
	I'll change this so that you can always encounter them, but sexual dialogue/options will be disabled if you have incest turned off
	
	even though I don't have a vagina I can get the virgin fetish with enchanted random kink
	
	Chastity cage & belt still allows some forms of masturbation
	
	Rough talk that does not degrade the Submissive? (Not using words like slut, bitch etc?)
	
	You can indefinitely delay either/both characters from climaxing by repeatedly displacing clothing.
		
	-re:sex partner not responding, not sure what's going on, but it apparently is doing something just not printing the text for it.
	 it is not uncommon for me to get "x is lubed y" messages when the partner's action is blank, as if they're rubbing their pussy/ass against my cock.
	  i'd also mentin that it's mostly in doggy style, though i only generally use that and recieving oral.

	-until there's some sort of strap-on, women using anal fetish tease and talking about fucking your ass don't really make sense.
	
	-could it be possible, perhaps after getting observant & deflowering, to tell if someone's mouth/ass/breasts(and dick now that you've added that) are virgin?
	
	I started a new game and I went to the slavers place, the guy there was acting like I already finished the slavers quest and I had full access to the slave content.
	
	Comments:
	-exe version still doesn't want to work on a 32-bit system. specific error message: "This version of %1 is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need a x86(32-bit) or x64(64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher." so this is me contacting you. :P not a major bug, the jar still works, just thought i'd point it out.
	
	-the tooltips for backgrounds in character creation aren't large enough to see everything being a soldier gives. it's fine for the rest, i think, but that one gets cut off.
	
	-can we have some way of seeing the entire current map? i.e. when standing on the street, showing the entire city map but not the maps for the mansion or harpy nests or such. maybe an option in the cellphone? naturally would be limited to what you've explored, unless you've got debug mode on, but still useful.
	
	Can you be in a submissive role with your children? I've noticed that the player character only takes the role of dominant, theres no alternative to submit to them.
	
	-might i suggest some tweaking of kate's services? as is it takes money for each step of the process, i.e. 200 for making your iris glow, 200 for making them heterochromatic, 200 for changing the second iris color, and 200 for making that glow, for a total of 800.
	maybe add a "buy" button on the left side, either under the description, or make it where the price is, make it only clickable after changing the options to the right, and only actually changing your appearance and charging the fee once you hit buy.
	--also, can we get a sclera(the area around the iris, typically white) color option?
	-would also like an option in transformative elixirs to have cross/plus(combination of vertical and horizontal) irises/pupils.
	
	-would a potion or transformation option to restore the drinker's virginity(s) be too cheaty?
	
	The only options given for getting a discount from ralph are "Do nothing" and "Calm down" you can still earn a 25% discount by just spamming the options until he's done but other than that you have no agency in the scene.
	Also when your penis is getting lubricated by your own precum (presumably, as you will see) the message is "Your penis yourcum" or something like that. It's weird.
	Additionally: It's impossible to lose penis virginity.
	Another bug, it seems that "shemale reactions" are disabled? Maybe i'm just encountering NPCs with an eye for the bulge but I recall NPCS being surprised that I'm a shemale. Not seeing that anymore.
	No one seems to react to me being a trap anymore either so I assume it's a bug. I seem to remember this happening in a previous build. I also have invincible penile virginity.
	
	sticky + oily cum? (and tapered + flared penises)
	
	I need to add a more general way to make demons change their body parts, so that you can order them to do it once you've taken them as slaves
	
	 I think the pc is submissive and kneeling to perform oral but dominant partner does not remove clothing to reveal sexual organs.  The scene just stayed in limbo after that.
	
	Cum on back is a repeatable action
	"Manage Clothing" is also repeatable
	
	i imported from previous patch and i still seem to have my slaves O.O
	
	Pressing enter while in a gender pronoun field takes you to a blank page

	slave obedience stuck at 99.600006
	
	Also, seeing NPC's show up from time to time with oddly long fractional numbers, such as vaginal capacity being displayed as 7.2000003 inches. So far I only see it happen with capacities if ever, in fact.
	
	Public stocks seem to ignore gender settings, specifically permitting NPC's to spawn that shouldn't according to the gender preferences menu. 
	
	in m/m sex scenes I saw npcs getting fairly confused when they are on top and they decide to move you back to a wall. With no vagina to penetrate they often perform only generic actions like kissing or jerking off.
If I can give a suggestion, in these situations they could perform some frotting or decide to change position.
	
	ornaments or clothing for racially blocked slots, horseshoes, wraps, bangles, plumage ornamentation.
	
	 Just want to let you know that the condom belt bug still exists in 1.88.1 Once the player acquires more than 8 used condoms, the player's clothing inventory screen stops displaying. Consuming one to bring the number to 8 or lower allows the worn items to be seen again. This is not the worn inventory showing all blank boxes, but rather the worn not showing at all, and just showing like the default map.
	
	In the newest version, requesting a position your partner doesn't want usually causes them to break and do nothing for a while.
	
	in the latest version after clicking resume it resets all "my" fetishes
	
	I'll add "butch" to the list of possibilities for NPCs to transform you into
	
	I don't know if anyone else mentioned this, but when I try to take off any witches clothing my character was wearing while importing nothing happens. Then when I take off a non witch clothing, the witch clothing that I tried to unequip disappears and doesn't show up in my inventory.
	
	inverted nipples
	
	When I attempted to open the fetishes page, the game crashed.
	
	-having sex with a pregnant slave from an imported save isn't fully detected - if you cum inside them the game says they have a chance of becoming pregnant, even though they already are. This is from a 187.7 export.

-Having a slave drink a tf potion when in a different slaves room has some of the descriptor text go to the incorrect slave. The TFs still go to the correct slave, it's just weird reading how one slave is transforming and then a different slave starts transforming. This applies only to some feature TFs, not all of them. Example A-Player is in Slave X's room. Slave Y drinks potion that adds extra breasts, lipples, and internal muscles to nipples. Description text will say that Slave Y got extra breasts and lipples, but slave X gets internal nip muscles. 


During sex, "Repeat Actions" tab contains entries to repeat shifting clothing and "Stay in position" when you cum.


Something else that looks like a repeated continuity bug from previous builds: When importing slaves from character export files (using the auction block), their genital stats are listed as undiscovered, even if the slave is initially wearing no obstructing clothing.


-can i ask how damage resistance is supposed to work? it seems to be a straight percentage, but if it were, higher than 100resistance would mean you take 0 of that type of damage, but i've got over 150 will resist and i still take direct will damage. not much, less than 1 per attack, usually, but still. if it's supposed to compete with the opponents damage stat, so if their damage% is higher than your resist%, you still take damage, that's sensible and less of an issue. still an issue, though as i keep taking the above damage from someone with only 130 will damage%. if, on the other hand, resistance is capped, so you can never block all damage, which again makes sense, then it is probably working right and you can ignore this.

-after getting scarlett as a slave, i went into permissions and changed what she should call me. typed it into the box, and pressed the checkmark a few times. when i then went to talk to her, she's still calling me by name. this strikes me as a bug, unless it's due to her being "defiant".

-at first i thought it was just because i was only having sex with people outside, but even when doing it with slaves, i haven't seen any sign of the "missionary" position. the patch notes have you adding an action to that position, so i assumed it was accessible.

-right after turning brax into bree, it acts like you have a choice between having sex or leaving, but there is no leave button.

Comments:
-can we possibly get something more permanent to tell us we've quicksaved? maybe have the notice stay on screen until we do something, at least. the current message is brief enough that it can be missed if you're not paying enough attention.
-maybe something similar for quickloading? it's usually obvious, but sometimes not.

-a slight issue with remove all, more of a minor annoyance than anything. sometimes, depending on what they are wearing it'll say something like "you pull down their pantyhose, you remove their panties, you replace their pantyhose. you remove their pantyhose." maybe tweak it so it check for blocks and removes the blocking clothes before the blocked ones?

-one thought i had to make the observant perk more obviously useful is to add gender to the list of characters present in the top right. so instead of saying "Scarlett - Harpy" or "A cat-girl - Cat-girl", it'll say something like "Scarlett - Shemale Harpy" or "A cat-girl - Tomboy Cat-girl".
-might also want to tweak what it says for randos, so it doesn't just say their race twice like that.

-maybe add a eat/drink/absorb 5 button for consumables?

-is there any way to reduce the cost of using fetish teases, as there is for spells?



The buggy TF description modifiers (not sure if there's more I missed)
-Tongue bifurcation
-puffy
-Internal ribbing
-internal muscle
-Internal tentacles
-Barbed Dick
-Flared Penis head
-knotted dick
-prehensile dick
-external ribbing
-external tentacles
-dick sheath
-dick tapering
	
	Suggestion: if it's not in, NPC giving multibreast TF.  If it is in, double-checking it's numbers.  I can't say in hours of playing the game that I've ever seen it happen if it's in.
	
	slave dialogue
	
	Doggy-style (oral)
	Anilingus should be available in face-to-wall too
	
	I can't seem to access the character details page at all for Lilaya or Rose
	
	Lilaya starts passionately kissing your exposed breasts, breathing in your command_unknown as she desperately presses her delicate lips against your skin. Pushing your chest out into her face, you let out a desperate squeal as you plead for her to continue.
	
	I will definitely add more functionality to the slave UI (such as being able to order them by name/stats). :3

I'll add descriptions for tasting the lubrication types on your fingers; great idea
	
	It seems that your partner will always cry out for your cum even though your character doesn't have a penis.
	
	Addiction will disappear if you wait beyond lvl 5 addiction withdrawal, removing both the withdrawal and addiction.
	
	When are freckles/beauty marks/skin blemishes going to be added?
	
	I feel like Horse Pussy should be innately muscled
	
	Requests not working?
	
	one or two more buttons on the sex UI over menu to cover the last 2-3 unique options taken
	I think having it record three of your past actions would be great, five would be ideal. If not that's fine, was just wondering if it could make it easier to access my favorite actions.
	5 [5] repeats
	10
	
	if you're doing that, might i suggest a fetish for talking? dirty/rough talking is another sex action that doesn't have a fetish to prevent corruption gain.
	
	First make a person addicted to the fluid in general.
	Then the specifics become more important to them. The taste, the flavor.
	Then the very cells inside the fluid, the DNA of the giver, becomes the addicting fluid
	the addiction was to guzzling it having it shot in your ass or getting creampied and impreged
	
	No options sometimes
	
	Have an interesting bug where all of my equipped items have disappeared. One moment they were there, now every slot is empty except for my on hand off hand weapons. Was using the condom belt and have 9 in inventory so far, but no item overflow occured.  
I am pretty sure i didn't hit unequip all and then walk away from it, because there are none of my old items in my basic inventory.  
Okay, just purchased and equipped a new condom belt, it vaporizes into the aether.  Drinking a condom made just the belt reappear, but adding a new condom this time caused the entire inventory (clothing equipped) to not show when i press the inventory button.
	
	need to get individual hand lubrications sorted
	
	I'll look into adding multiple types of horns for each race
	
	I will add a way to take charge in the "slave initiates sex" scenes ^^
	
	add a related fetish to allow for corruption-free vaginal sex
	
	when you have sex and orgasm, you get almost 4 hours of the "strengthened aura" effect, which prevents you from gaining essence from your orgasms until it fades. is it intended that orgasming while you have that effect resets it's timer, without giving essence? because it is quite annoying to have 5 minutes left of it, have sex with someone, and suddenly be back to 4 hours until i can gain more essence that way.
	
	-exe version seems to require a 64-bit environment, which is troublesome for those of us with 32-bit. this was tru in the previous public version too.

	-special teases seem to mis-judge how much damage they'll do. i.e. before using them they say ~20-25 damage, but using one, on someone with the appropriate opposite fetish(sub tease on dom, etc), does ~13 WP damage. and the opponent has -50% WP resistance, is bisexual, and does not have any effects or anything i can see that would reduce WP damage.
	-similarly, there are other tooltips that display the wrong value. enchanting price, for instance, seems to mostly be wrong whether you have the transformer perk or not.
	
	-i am somewhat annoyed by how lilaya keeps pulling my pants down and my underwear aside, despite my underwear being crotchless, my pants unzipped, and my dick already in her.
	 maybe have it check if clothes even need to be displaced before it tries to?
	
	-event log is still running behind the times, though it only seems to happen once there are a lot of events listed. not that that takes long as nothing seems to remove events from the log, and loading a save makes the event log show all the events it did when the save was made.
	
	-i have had several defeated sex partners that after a bit, have stopped doing anything. that is, a standard sex turn has text of you doing something, ongoing effects, them doing something, ongoing effects.
	 for some reason, the them doing something area winds up being blank.
	
	-quickloading is somewhat better now, but now the minimap sometimes stops updating when quickloading.
	
	as far as other non-bug ideas:
	-one small idea i had was to have one store, maybe near the entrance, that will buy anything at all you have to sell, rather than having different stores buy different things.
	-also, maybe having buttons when you're standing outside of the stores that let you jump directly to other stores, rather than going back to the entrance, then to the store?
	
	also, the unresponsive partners thing seems to mainly happen to me with defeated randoms when neither of us is doing anything ongoing(partner is forbidden self actions) and i'm mainly hitting "calm down" over and over, since i don't want to cum due to the strengthened aura bug mentioned below.
	
	-global resist seems to do nothing from any source, while global damage seems to increase both "Pure" damage and resist, at lease according to the pop-up that shows when hovering over my name.
	
	Comments:
	-in enchanted potions, would it be possible to combine similar effects, so that rather than having a potion that says "+1 fitness" a dozen or so times over and over, just says "+12 fitness" or whatever the full value is?
	
	-in combat, maybe have the tease/spell icons under the HP/WP/SP bars in the middle of the screen be clickable to use that tease/spell?
	
	I might change that soon so that they spawn, but without any lewd options if you have incest turned off
	
	The subject for Lilaya's testing seems to be the last character you talked to rather than the slave the slavery overview says it's being done to.
	
	So the girls I meet have "one pair of average-sized tits" even with multi-breasts on, and maximum furry preferences 
	
	There is a bug where trying to get the discount at Ralph's Snacks freezes the game
	
	Got a bug, when i was sucking a witches cock she said "Put out i don't want to taste your cum "
	
	So, while riding my son's cock, kissing him and fingering my own ass, he tells me to pull out because he doesnt want to taste my cum :stuck_out_tongue:
	Also, condom belts when removed during sex are called microskirts
	it was fixed by removing an item of clothing
	
	Addictive fluids
	
	Add orgasm/pullout actions & cum-soaked effects
	One of the annoying things NPCs can do is to pull away when they orgasm while being roughly fucked. This is merely text related but I don't want to be pulled out, I want them to deal with it without "pushing my hips away"
	
	STORY
	
	"dirty talker" fetish - increases NPC dirty talk
	
	analingus toggle in the content-settings
	
	I just can't wait to have the option back to have your partner cum in your hand... and then finger yourself
	leg locking
	knotting & mutual knotting
	Struggling to get the flare into tight orifices
	chastity cage orgasm denial
	orgasm denial
	cunnilingus/anilingus on creampied orifice
	want tongue length to factor into cunnilingus.
	
	STORY
	
	suck on nipples
	I'll definitely be reworking a few of the actions in sex, and I'll most likely make masturbation an ongoing action as you suggest. ^^
	I'll also try and do the same for nipple/breast play. :3
	
	
	Sex:
		submissive sex with slaves
		And I will get submissive sex with your offspring added for the next release! :3
		rimming
		hotdogging & intercrural
		urethra fucking
		better cumshot hit-detection for more messy and consequential sex
		cum infaltion & puddles
		Add more reveal reactions & tidy them up
		
	Sex AI:
		Brax anal: he's not doing those either, regardess of what I suggest.
		I have a minor problem with the recent hotfix, though, it seems like all NPCs tend to do p(n)aizuri in my kneeling pose, even if they have an oral fetish.
			 I had almost 50 fights already, and I haven't been fed cum in a single one of them, which makes me sad and hungry.
		I just tried to use a condom and not pull out with Lilaya and yet the game reacted as if it was not there. (duplicate report from someone with brax)
		selecting fingering overrides kissing. It's either or
		I'll get it fixed for the next version so that if you request anal (and they're not being rough/doing whatever they want), they'll always go for that first
			Worth noting, at least in what I've tested NPC's will almost never choose anal; to the point of a doll NPC with the buttslut fetish in the dominant role starting cowgirl and then kissing until the scene ends, which seems like it's probably not the intended behavior.
		It looks like a bug crept in where it's not correctly accounting for the sub resisting during sex scenes and displaying the right dialogue for that.
		In several cases you have the NPC or PC acting as if they're in a different pace other than the resisting one.
		One small bug or confusing mix up I have noticed is that slaves who hate me but are obedient do a weird thing in sex where they do the "no, please don't" line before sex,
			then enjoy every second of the pounding and beg me to do it more, then "sob with relief" when I'm done. It's a bit jarring. Other than that I've encountered no bugs.
		Brittany's other sex positions don't show until selecting doggy style, which for me was the only initial sex position
		When you are the submissive partner during sex, you are still given the option to pull out when you orgasm even when there's nothing to pull out from.
		NPCs seem to almost exclusively prioritize playing with their breasts
		Do deflowering fetish AIs prioritize removing virginity?  If yes, are they coded to do so for penile virginity if they have a vagina?
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Slaves in the export file don't retain their family relations from the previous game. So if you have some Lilaya's daughter working as her assistant, then after exporting her with your character she isn't her daughter anymore.
	
	
	How about some slaves being possessive over you? Example for this: They get jealous when noticing you've been having sex with someone else and jumps you to dominate you for that reason? Maybe an added Possession kink to those who would do that.

16 November 2017
[03:51] the sarssol: we really oughta be able to call slaves to our room/mess with the slave menus from our room
[04:54] Leob70: I'd also like my less obedient or dominant slaves to "visit" me when I rest.
	
	
	if a demon has the tf fetish they dont tf you when you lose.
	
	slaves with the tf fetish shouldn't lose obedience for acting as test subjects
	
	Every now and then, me or my parftner will be stuck with the current number displayed until we orgasm again.
	If I orgasm at 100 and my partner at 98 or something, if I spam a button, occasionally it locks it there on the screen 
	However, I can still force another one if I spam an action, which will eventually cause a second orgasm followed by a count reset 
	
	
	Is it possible that there will eventually be a forced TF gender preference system
	
	is it possible to add a cumulative line to the sex stats page for cum given/taken?  It's not super important or anything just would be kind of neat to see without adding it all up
	
	By the way, I guess it's known but you never know.. : A slave got another slave pregnant but the UI says I impregnated her and that I had children with her, although .. Not really, I don't even have a dieck
	
	my slave is anal and breast virgin whenever she is ambushing me... then I deflower that... and next time I meet her it's back ... LOL yaay deflowering 
	
	Make "use you" affect dominion too
	
	Enchant : If you click "Add" then "increase potency" you spend more essence but the result is the same as before you increase the potency.... umm basicly , the moment you click "Add"  is where the potions potency multiplier stops working , but essence is still spent as it would be for  a higher potency potion.
	
	when they hate you deeply they will be like "Who's the slave now?" and when they start liking you it changes to "Stay still and enjoy this" 
	
	: Just a reminder you can still undress rose on the hand holding sesion
	
	It'd be great to make it so when you make someone drink a transformative potion with random racial transformations, it would try to only transform what is existing, because 3/4 of my potion went into some "... already lacks/has ... so nothing happens " 
	
	Odd. I just had a female character push my male character's face against the wall with intent to fuck him. She didn't have the necessary equipment, obviously... so she started riding his cock somehow, without turning him around?
	
	
	could we get the replacement of displaced clothes as a slave permission toggle? Sorta like whether they are allowed to wash themselves?
		that way you could pull down a maids blouse then order her to go about her day and duties with her tits out of her uniform.
	
	
	When the feminine transformation slave event drops, it's reporting that "Lilaya tested some very intrusive transformations on the cat-girl", regardless of actual race or gender of the slave (in this case, a horse-boy and cow-boy).

Edit: Also, when enchanting a Sugar Carrot Cube, I'm apparently able to enchant a Horse-Morph Horns transformation. If I do this, it has the expected effect (remove horns), but it's still reporting wrong on the enchanting screen.
	
	
	I'll add an obedience gain for NPCs addicted to your fluids, yes (the reasoning being that they're willing to do as they're told in order to get more of the fluid they're addicted to).
	
	The new position selection is not working as it should, even if the npc has an valid fetish, 90% of the time it chooses the "back to the wall" position, even in situations that is not possible to start penetrative sex in this position.
	
	When you try to have sex with slaves and their obedience is too low, they will try to be the ones in charge, giving the player the option to accept or resist. Maybe if the permission 'Use you' is turned on?
	
	It seems that the position request is not working, i tried on a lot of different enemies with different fetishes, but they never accept those requests.
	
	add the ability to assign slaves to your room
	
	The Unisex accesories part of Nyan's store has too many items and it looks like some of the enchanted versions are cut off and not shown
	
	Hey, just wondering. Are horns always only going to be available as white?
	Also, I would like to suggest we get a dang color changing potion soon. The shop is expensive and charges immediately rather than letting you pick and choose a shopping list to decide before executing
	
	Kate:
		: Just make sure they're a confirmation before the purchase/change. Preferably in bulk, so you if you're about to over spend you can reprioritize
	
	When you get forceflly transformed, specifically with breasts.
It says "and grown larger" instead of have or has or some other sentence correction
	
	add in an option to enable scaled NPC leveling soon
	
	Every time they try to turn me into a male of a different species (or any gender that has a penis), the only thing that will change is the penis.
		On repeat transformations they will change several things but this initial first encounter always only changes the penis type even if you have the TF fetishes. Not sure if this is by design or a bug.
		Also it should be noted that if they just want to change the size then usually at least one other transformation will occur. But again, if they're changing the type it's always only going to be that one change.
	
	Will there be a way to "free" slaves so you can either encounter them locally/get rid of them? Despawning children would be nice too.
	
	I haven't clearly telegraphed that (spoiler) all of the witches are futa, but I'll add that in for the next version
	
	ill just put this here to look back to : Slave "Use you" preferably make it a request from slave with the Dominant/submissive option after you Accept . :sweat_smile:  im not realy sure i like my slaves jumping me and pinning me down :joy: . and i feel Mistery Kink is a bit too rare , with Innoxias gift at least ya know succubus drops it with a chance if u keep at it .
	
	Washing restores HP
	
	A lot of the transformations that NPCs force on you seem to affect gender more than anything else. Any chance that they'd tell you what they're planning to turn you  into? I think some of them say so if you spit the potion out.
	What brings this up specificaaly, is that I don't want my characters gender/genitals to change. maybe the toggle tf option could have a toggle tg option?
	
	Not sure if it's on the list, but during sex the titlebar "Sex: Face-to-Face", doesn't reflect the actual positions of the scene anymore.
	
	Trying to change my name softlocks the whole game
	i cant leave the "change your name" screen at all, even via menus
	
	I'll also make a week-long vote tomorrow asking Epic & Legendary patrons which of the last two major features I should work on in 0.1.9 (mutliple-partner sex or stat & combat rework), as well as what character/area of the game I should focus on in 0.1.89. :3
	
	Couple of minor bugs relating to sex acts, the first is that the essences gained is still not showing the right number gained, the second is that dom sex is not being recorded as being with that NPC.
	
	I'm talking about getting them on their knees as a sub.  Last we checked you'd locked that to oral performers, though it would make sense for breast fetishists as well.
	That was the only position that most AIs would refuse to take.
	(Even ones where they'd be unable to engage in any act, like face to all when partner has no cock.)
	I don't know how much was changed with the big AI refactor though.
	I haven't tested it yet.
	
	Events for slaves
	
	Use you
	House freedom
	
	add a 'Cowgirl (bottom)' position for dominant sex as soon as I can
	
	: Did you get the breast fetishests to actually use kneeling now?
	Oh, so oral performers are still more into breastplay than breast fetishests?
	
	Also, unsure if this is intentional or a bug, or even how long its been around, but it that appears NPC's also don't keep their desired 'form' for transforming you when you re-load a game. 
	i.e. a NPC used to be trying to make the PC a cat-morph, after a reload, they try to make PC a squirrel morph.
	
	Added basic transformative effects to events for slaves with feminine and masculine testing permissions enabled while working as a test subject. (Will be improved upon for Friday.)
	
	thigh sex
	
	Cosmetics for slaves
	
	
	Kind of a late bug report for 1.87, but I noticed that anal virginity might not be properly retained for slaves on character export.
	 I had a slave who I could have sworn still had her anal virginity, yet after exporting the character file (both created and exported in 1.87.1), her appearance screen no longer states the "She has retained her anal virginity" line.
	   It might be one of those odd bugs where the game shows different information irrespective of the export's information since the file still has a virgin="true" flag for anus.
	
	Bug (Hotfix version): Slave Scarlett isn't attracted to me, so the slave interaction is "rape" not "sex" - however, when choosing it, Scarlett engages in consensual sex with all of what that means:
	 no resisting, unlimited orgasms, etc.
	
	
	
	obviously we can get tfed normally by potions and stuff but I was thinking "what if slimes themselves could also slowly tf us~"(edited)
	say like if you fuck or get fucked by a slime you get a status effect called covered in slime/a better name than that~(edited)
	and it stacks a lot
	and once you max it out you'll start gaining slime parts~ :3
	as you get more it'll start messing with you and it'll be blantently obvisous if you don't wash it off something is going to happen to you~
	and the process of turning into one this way could be very pleasureable as it melds with your body and starts turning the rest of you into a slime~ :3(edited)
	in part with this~ I was thinking of a possible slime npc/entire slime family/cult of slimes that could have a scene of constantly using you with futa cocks until you become a slime
	
	
	During exhibitionism: while travelling in open map, a rare chance of a passer-by groping the NPC's exposed parts
	
	Sort out Cultist sex actions
		Dirty talk
		Orgasm is them masturbating over your face/cumming inside you
			Orgasm is not working well atm
		Virginity loss
	Some of the content hasn't been properly edited/proofread.
	
	
	
	split up the second set of parsing options into player and npc variants
	
	Also it seems like there's a pretty huge penalty to affection and obedience when you slap a collar on someone.
	 Which... makes sense. But it seems like that penalty should vary depending on fetishes. Submissive people take a much smaller penalty.
	  Dominant people take a much larger one. Maybe a special 'pet' fetish where someone fantasizes about being property to the point they get a bonus when enslaved.
	
	A (hopefully) small thing that would to me make far more sense when dealing with slaves would be to have an inventory option when interacting with slaves directly (clicking on their name when in their room) would be very useful. I always default to clicking on my slaves' names when I want to give them something.
	
	 i dont think it been mentioned yet in the past but i encountered a bug where getting knocked up by ralph led me to giving birth to a pair of squirrel children when im pure human and hes a pony hehe

	Make way to change date in new game & in buggy menu
	
	-"Global Resist" bonuses from equipment do not actually seem to do anything at all. It certainly doesn't actually show up anywhere in my stats, including when I hover over my name. "Global" DMG/Resist from fetishes or other sources may or may not do anything, I really can't tell.

	-Sometimes quick-loading can eventually cause the game to become somewhat unresponsive. Tooltips still pop up, and buttons still change when you hover over them, but nothing reacts when clicked, nor when the appropriate key is pressed. Loading is similarly blocked. The only fix I've found is to close the game and go back. Fortunately does not seem to occur when resuming the game after re-opening, so you don't lose much progress. It seems to mostly occur when loading the game while in a conversation(in a store, in/just before a fight/etc), but occasionally at other points.(And I do mean loading, I did save in a safe place.) Also, usually it lets you do some things after loading before it kaputs, so it's unpredictably annoying.
	
	-Hovering over the partner's arousal bar in sex makes it flicker wildly, and does not show a pop-up.
	
	-The event log is one behind what actually happened. I.E. I level up and raise all my stats by 1, it shows strength and intelligence but not fitness, if I then go in and raise strength by 1 more, fitness going up now shows but the second strength raise doesn't.
	
	-After a fight, my current flames seems to go up more than it says it should, for no apparent reason. I.E. start with 14, win a fight, it says I gain 46 and should be 60, I actually have 94.
	
	-The "Observant" perk's "Gender Detection" function doesn't seem to actually do anything, but this might just be me missing some fine detail. Where exactly is this supposed to show up?
	
	I may have forgotten others, but I've also got a few comments/questions:
	-Where are the race lore books? The only one I've found is the harpy one that you are given in harpy nests.
	-Encyclopedia does not show stats for clothing, only colors.
	-Is there a reason the city map is randomized with each new game?
	-Can we please get a "Drop All" button in main inventory in our room? So we can store all the items in our inventory, rather than just 1 type of item at a time.
	--Similarly, a "Sell All" in stores to sell everything that store will buy.
	---To note, for these I mean in the same screen as the "Take All", "Displace All", "Replace All", etc.
	
	And, of course, I think of something else right after I post that.
	-Can we get a change of priority for the "Effects" icons, particularly in sex? If you get too many fetishes, the icons for those push the icons for ass/mouth/boobs/pussy status down to where you have to scroll to see them.
	And as soon as you do any actions, it scrolls back up to the top of the effects.
	
	Playing as a male, wearing a chastity cage, and with zero output of sperm I somehow still manage to dirty the chastity device even though the text describes the inability to produce cum.
	
	And another one about sex
	-Whether you and your partner come together can effect which orgasm scenes you are able to see. I've mainly noticed it when getting a blowjob while dominant, coming together prevents the choices for deepthroat and facial from showing up. May be others, but I either haven't seen them or narrowed them down yet.
	
	Found another one I had not seen previously.
	-I ran into a succubus daughter named Shawna, and after having sex with her nipples it says "Shawna's Nipple Virginity was taken by Shawna", pretty much every time she reveals them.
	 Considering my name is not Shawna, this is both inaccurate and annoying to have it show up every single time she takes off her bra.
	
	
	it's a little odd to see text about what someone's semen is like before they've had an orgasm
	
	
	EDIT 2: So, I did some experimenting with the enchantments, and I think there's a bug with how the transformer fetish works. Normally, it should halve the cost (from 6 to 3, for example).
	 Well, it displays that halved number, but then it halves it again. So, if something costs 3 essences, it'll only count 1 when you add the effect.
So basically, the transformer fetish actually reduces the cost of enchantments by 75% instead of 50%. Although I'm glad that the grinding is even more reduced, I assume that this is unintended behavior, so I'll count it as a "good" bug.
	
	when im receiving doggystyle, id like the option of a back Arch
	
	 I can't actually forbid my slave to undress during sex. Or forbid self-penetrative acts, for that matter.
	
	: I had a bug where some of my fetish teases like the cum stud tease weren't available on an imported character that had the fetish. But resetting my fetishes and buying them back fixed the issue. I'm assuming there was an update to some of the tease mechanics?
	
	BUGS & SEX
	
	You are unable to go more then one round during sex anymore with anybody who wants it, once both are done so is the encounter. The location screen is not updating with number of times you have had sex either
	
	change offspring to imps for the next update
	
	Two quick notes, for you next release. One adjust the text for post sex to reflect the new levels for essences. The second is a bit harder, make it so the first time you read the race books in a game you get the Int bonus, that way you can get it every game and not just the first game you read the book.
	
	Can the succubi still grow a cock once enslaved
	
	character creation virginity tooltips all say anal virginity kept
	
	importing makes my character have every single fetish
	
	Apparently the height of male kids with both very tall parents wraps around back to midget values
	
	before having TF fetish cost to remove penis is 7 essence, and after it shows as 3, therefore having halved it, and then when added to the effects, it halves it again to 1
	
	Why does a topless exhibitionist in backless panties have more willpower damage bonus than one in crotchless panties or one just going commando? She actually has +16 total to it (+4 for breasts and +12 for general nudity), and one going commando has only the +12 bonus for full frontal nudity. The same goes for the player character as for the NPCs.
	It's as if the topless bonus was counted twice for that particular case.
	
	When I import my character from last version, it gives me all fetishes except the two transformation ones.
	
	Hostile encounters in a non-hostile tile will cause the relevant NPC to remain in the tile indefinitely, with little if any interactions to do with them.
	
	"Store All" when in your room. Individually pressing buttons is a bit too much on the micromanaging side.
	
	The Viscous and Sticky cum modifiers should make the creampied status last for longer
	
	add an option to reduce the encounter of Offspring
	
	Those with the Transformation Test Subject Fetish will automatically swallow transformation pills.
	
	Oh yes the other thing I can not seem to feed Scarlet any potions to mod her
	
	sort of a bug descripting error. When you have a breeding bitch walking around and you ignore her for a few days to let one of your slave studs knock her up.
	 She blames you for being the dad even though you and she know you didn't have sex with her. not sure how to fix it
	
	For me the people that I get pregnant stay pregnant. To prove if it wasn’t just my mind I rested for 32 days and I check my pregnancy stats to see that all the women I impregnated are still pregnant.
	
	Found a bug: If you play as a male and have a male and a female slave and both are allowed to have sex with each other and the female gets pregnant, she says the child if from the PC but it's not listed (obviously cuz the whole thing makes no sense^^) on the fathered children stats.
	
	I will definitely be improving the AI in sex over these next two weeks. I'll also add an event for the "Use You" permission for slaves (I didn't get time to add it in just yet).
	
	One thing that I'll do right away, however, is your suggestion for the orientation changes. I'll give it an associated essence cost, as well as giving ambiphilic some sort of buff.
	
	Vixen's Virility doesn't increase virility at all. 
	
	changing slaves permissions affect obedience/affection?
	
	I think the forced transformations are bugged, every time I get forced TFd by an NPC only one, maximum two transformations happen despite me having the subject fetish.
	
	Must they always patronise your size?. I went as large as the game will let me and it's still 'cute' and 'little'.
	
	Besides that, I have an export with a slave that had 100 for affection and obedience drop to the negatives for affection and mid 80's for obedience the moment I was able to move them to a room (after unlocking slave content since you still have to do that when importing). 
	
	-I noticed that importing a character and skipping the intro leaves you with an empty inventory and no currency. Importing a character and doing the prologue gives a similar result except you have a burning opaque demonstone equipped and have 40 currency. A new character doesn't have these issues. 

	-My imported character also started with nearly all fetishes enabled except for the transformer and transformation test subject fetishes.
	
	- Minor bug this time, but it appears NPC's are once again calling large dicks small, the only time the seem to acknowledge it as 'big' is when the game is describing it as 'enormous'.
	
	The bug is that all androgynous characters seem to be spawning with high femininity.
	
	-The pronouns one requires that you save your changes, the others do not.  Often leads to forgetting to save.  (You might be able to ghost the save button on the back button to save text boxes)
		-A reset to default option would be useful on the other option settings as well, given how many options there are / will be.
		-Content options still isn't inside the options menu, for some reason.
		Shouldn't resume be greyed out if there's no save to resume?
	
	BUG -- Well, more of a logic error. When a NPC transforms you and gives you a dick, they still react like they didn't expect it when they remove your clothing. And its not as if they gave you a random cocktail without knowing the results, they specifically say what they are trying to turn you into.
	
	I haven't added a fetish that avoids vaginal penetration corruption gains... Oops... I'll get this sorted as soon as I can; thank you for bringing this to my attention
	
	working in a bar/brothel/milking shed, training
	
	It seems that the stretching mechanic doesn't work right in this version, but is fine in the previous version.
	
	Some of the items aren't properly configured to be able to be used on NPCs during sex. I'll try and get that fixed as soon as I can!
	
	During character creation, every time you change gender or femininity, physical resistance goes up by 6. By spamming cycle gender you can easily get 100+ physical resistance.

	Debug mode still refers to enchanting being in Lilaya's house
	
	add an event where a disobedient slave working as a chef cums on your food?
	
	
	you should put the general overview option in the players room. while having the room and that slaves function be in their respective rooms. while also preventing you from changing a slave who is in another room.
	: I don't know how hard it would be to do that but I feel like while I'm in a particular room I should only be able to mess with that room. but at the same time I'd like to have a central spot to control most everything from

		Make a new initNewGameWithImport()
	
	Add a couple more slave traders
	
	--------
	
	
	add special behaviour in alleyways/harpy nests for if you're wearing the enforcer's uniform
	
	Suggestion: Some where to remind the you that your character is max in a TF.
	  Max masculinity, max size of something, etc.  Or otherwise indicating you might be getting close.  You only get a 'potion does nothing' when you try to go passed it.
	
	Innoxia you can add enforcers as rescuers? I mean when you are raped or you rape there is chance that you be rescued (or stopped if you rape someone) by enforcers
	
	suggestion: strap-on for pix
	
	Job Suggestions: Helping out in each of the Shops... or at least the gym.
	
	Got issues with the sex AI still, and now you can't keep slaves from doing their own thing during scenes, so you can get stuck having to try and stop them from fingering you or themselves 3-5 times before they actually stop.
	
	For some reason, after I had one of my slaves fuck my character and their impregnation attempt failed, it's like they became barren and absolutely dry. o_O
	
	Refine Forced TF racial limits
	
	: I also agree with non-combat solutions.  I think that'd be great.  I end up getting "mad" that all these NPC's attack me.  If I could open up a dialog and such, trade sex for items rather than raping/stealing... something.
	   Is that just me?
	Oh, man, a Quick Defeat option would be great.  If they don't back down, you could Intimidate them.
	  If they've always lost to you, maybe they just Sumbit automatically... either by begging not to be hurt/raped or by saying "Oh, it's you?  Can we just get to the good part?" or somethhing.
	
	Suggestion: How about being able to lend your shirt or over torso wear to NPCs to raise affection?
	
	Brittany's scene seems to end after her orgasm. Not sure if intended or not.
	
	Not sure if intended, but I cannot get to a second page of options when having sex wit the three Harpies.  I think this has also happened with other fights, but I most noticed it here.
		At some point after they take off their cloths—I think... can't be sure—the second page of options opens up.

	How do you feel about offspring genders? There's quite an array available, but they only ever pick from two. It's a very small change to switch them to using the same system used for generic NPCs.
	
	Possible memory leak?
		Equipping a long sleeve dress on a trap caused a crash.
	
	new breast size: HYPER("universal", "XXXX", 101, 120) ;
	
	: That's a very good suggestion, especially the part about the selfie descriptions being a little overwhelming to read through :thinking:
	 I was considering putting a summarised version at the top
	And also, I should probably make some kind of indication for what parts are exposed in sex's status panel
	
	
	NPC likes being TF'd fetish:
		letting you use TF items on them during fights or when you're a sub partner in sex.
	
	add plasticity to the stats shown when looking at an NPC's orifices?
	
	
	Saliva as fluid
	
	- Perhaps a help option for some options, (he doesn't know what is an average breast size is)
	
	
	SEX
	
	My character has recently grown a dick after losing to a dog-morph (forced tf). After blowing her wad maybe once or twice since, she has been unable to cum again
	
	Fetish:
		Increases potency of forced TF potions [+3 effects each for giver & taker]
	
	NPCs will now apply all of their genital preferences to one potion. (This doesn't work, as TFs are slow!)
	Forced TF racial limits options not working yet!
	
	Not sure if this is intended, but certain races seem to be locking to certain forced TF's.
	 For example, I seem to only have female cat morphs cause a trap harpy TF, nobody else seems to want to turn my character into a trap, but on female cat morphs, it's a regular preference and it's only harpy as well.
	  Female cow morphs seem to consistently want to turn my character into a male cow morph despite their personal preferences being something entirely different. Even female/female prefence cow morphs want to turn my character into a male.
	   It seems like it's locking the preference for all characters of that type based off the first encounter.
	speeding up forced TFs received from randomly generated enemies
	
	
	
	Breeder collar:
		it would be literally purrfect as a slave collar instead of just a normal clothing item.
		which would be super amusing because instead of someone only being shocked that something is a slave collar, their words would be cut off near the end with said needy moan as they teleported. 
		and of course when possible it adds the breeder fetish, and if possibly leaves their pussy permanently dripping wet~
		
	Additions:
		Also, any follow ups on already exposed states pre combat/sex? Being an exhibitionist virtually removes all npc reactions from the game, which is wierd!

		Now that I got you thinking about dialogue, it's awesome that different characters might say "breed me" or "don't cum inside me" but I wish there was more continuity after I do or don't cum inside them.
			It would be cool to have the 'unwanted creampie' affect i.e. "wtf, I said don't cum inside assh*le!" Ya know, especially with a huge cum attribute adding, "there's no way that doesn't knock me up!" perhaps an incest optional,
				"I can't believe I'm going be bear by own dads' children!"
		bdsm equipment do anything or allow us to increase obendience
		some more piercings would be fun. Like adding Helix earrings, septum rings, Jacobs Ladder, Eyebrow Studs, Snake bite studs, e.t.c.
			 And maybe some other types of rings, like a dragon ring, a Horcrux ring, the One Ring, and other cool fantasy rings.
	
	
	Bugs:
		Feeding slave pot while in Finch's place makes some of the descriptions return Finch descriptions
		NPCs will be revolted by the cocks that they give you with transformatives, this guy gave me a potion which gave me a feline cock then took of my dress and said "What, I thought you were a good girl!" which was pretty funny actually.
		Seems the trait of having multiple rows of breasts is randomly assigned to NPCs.
			Even if I have maximum furry and multi-breast preferences, NPCs who are listed as having furry morphed breasts are still described more often than not as having "one pair" of breasts. 
		seems like none of the ladies, including broodmothers, are producing any milk after giving birth.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	MAJOR:
	
	Im not sure if loading a game is clearing all the data from the previously active load. It seems to occur when Im doing a bit of save scumming to try and get the right forced TF.
	 Each time I load the game runs slower and slower. The buttons lag and take a significantly long time to proceed.
	  It's typically resolved by closing and reopening the game completely but as the game gets larger, it could potentially be a problem. I've only tested on the .exe version of the game,
	   and so you dont think it's a computer issue, the memory usage keeps increasing per load, and Im using an upper-end machine.
	    Without getting into things in great detail it could be a potential memory leak or things arent being cleared fully from the previous session on loading.
	The only things I did between saves was spam explore, then fight, submit, see the tf, load save before sex scene if I didnt like it. This was with TF's on and a TF fetish as well. 
	
	
	
	clothing: nipple crosses on flat chests
	
	Pubic hair TF working?
	
	Do you plan to add something like "permission to have sex with you without asking"? =D Would be nice if this can happen after you went to sleep and they just join you.
	
	
	I'll add several peaceful ways to resolve conflict (pay them, allow them to fuck you, run away, intimidate them, etc.) as soon as I can! ^^
	
	
	newly grown vaginas should appear with average stats in regards to tightness, wetness, ect. Instead of the absolute minimum values
	
		
	'floppy' and 'size' ear modifiers to my todo list, so that you'll be able to get long, floppy ears
	
	ex. -1 elixir. the text come out 2 times but the effect is still 1 so no problem
	-3 elixir. the text come out 5 times but the effect is still 3 so no problem
	
	
	You seem to get lubrication alerts even when you can't see or know about the other person.
	For example:
	>Penis - Unknown!
	>The horse-girl's equine cock is quickly lubricated by the horse-girl's precum.



	I will definitely add more options for the inital encounter of NPCs. I'll add several peaceful ways to resolve conflict (pay them, allow them to fuck you, run away, intimidate them, etc.) as soon as I can! ^^
		A good idee for the "run away" action that the NPC could so iguess is; if you fought a particular NPC multiple times (say 5 times) and won those all in a row, the NPC would recognize you and atempt to flee.
		 You can then give the player a option to a)Let them go or b)stop them from fleeing. This could be tied into the Sadist perk as a added bonus, and maybe your speed/stamina stat would determine if you catch him/her or not.


	
	If you lose your character's virginity to their/someone's else tail, any kind of it - vaginal, anal or oral - then in your character's description (phone→selfie) you will have this sentence:
You lost your anal virginity to.
The first time you performed oral was to.
It lacks something before the period.

	Investigate UI sluggishness
	
	Ummm... I'm in a scene where both arousal bars just got frozen. >.>
	It started after I used the Suck Clit command in the scene. Gonna try another and see if the issue repeats.
	No repeat. Let me see if it's tied to Denial fetish.
	X ive seen times where it looks like the other persons bar froze because i was raping them, but never my own bar
	My scene was not a rape one, but the NPC had the Denial fetish. After I used the Suck clit option, the NPC's bar froze, then when my char got to climax, that bar froze as well. o_O
	And NPC's seem to be unable to remove your bra if you remove your panties at the same time. Not sure if it's just related to the maid set or not. o_O
	I also notice that if you're wearing the maid's dress, the NPC you're in scene with will get the blocked stripes on the legs slot.
	And their blocked stripes get removed if your maid's dress is removed. lol
	
	add an item that influences your children's starting gender
	
	assign slaves to room service for a modifier to price or even a x amount of free service
	
	what about improving your bedroom for better resting perks? ( change the game so you need to rest longer to regain more) but nicer room improves the rate of health return
	
	There is an issue with the levels of fluid production.
	 150 ml may be 20 times the average ejaculation but it is enough to fill only something of the size of a tea cup, clearly not something that should cause stomach distension which does in the game.
	  When measuring levels like these it is a good idea to use a logarithmic scale, something like 1<10<100<1000.

	-----------------
	
	Finish character creation
		I need to finish the backgrounds, add in sex experience stuff, then add in an opportunity to have sex with the random NPC, then integrate the end of the character creator into the rest of the prologue
		
		shrug it off an approach the crowd, where a guy/girl approaches you and starts talking [background, xp points]
		
		the strange atmosphere seems to be growing in intensity, and you suddenly find yourself talking about sex [sex background, sex exp]
		
		React differently based on if you're virgin, "normal" or slut, start heading towards the museum bathroom
		Get stopped by Lily, she's panicking about Arthur (partner sighs and says they'll find you later).
	
		hoodies
	
	
	Add more ways to influence affection and obedience.
		take for walks
		punish
		talk
		hug
		kiss
	Sex with slaves for some reason when you end it you collapse and they walk away after doming you.
		
	CUM EFFECTS
	
	-----------------
		
		
	talk our kids into taking another name. Or just make the decision for them
	
	Incest Content still says Not Implemented when selecting the fetish.
		
	
	Condoms:
		track cum
		inseminate action
			Filled condoms keep track of the type of cum that they're holding, and can now be used to artificially inseminate characters.
			The offspring of any resulting pregnancy will have traits based on the the cum's stored body values.
			E.g. Obtaining a filled condom from a dog-boy, and then transforming him into a cat-girl, then impregnating her with the filled condom, will result in offspring inheriting traits from her old dog-boy body, as well as her new cat-girl one.
		
	Condense essences into just arcane essences
	Use essences to unjinx something
	
	Add self-doggy actions to SubDoggy and DomDoggy

	personality for named NPCs
	
	are content toggle settings supposed to influence the fetishes NPCs can spawn with?
		Cause they currently don't seem to do so and it seems like they should. IE non con and incest fetishes probably shouldnt be in the NPC spawn list if those fetishes are toggled off.

	spiked and messy hair
	
	Gate getPlayerVaginaVirginityLossDescription() descriptions behind masochist/virginity fetishes
	
	Limit NPC hair styles based on maximum length
	
	Reduce number of children
	Pregnancy rework to take into account safe days
	
	Full screen
	
	Even if you have thin or normal lips, most of the sex actions describe them as plump or full.
	
	[Need to make it so if there's only one partner, possibility is certain]
		And the game's not recognizing that my character is already preggo. It still shows only as High probabillity
	
	
	Also some of the clothing has to be manually removed by going into inventory as the npc's or you cant do it themselves mostly seems to affect undies layer clothing
	
	Selling the magic gems and feathers, you cant sell them some times sell all sell one nothing happens and they stay in inventory
	
	more cum-covered status effects, as well as cum-inflation scenes.
	
	I would love to take slaves out on a leash, even if its just to get their makeup/hair done.
	
	-bug: this is kind of funny, but you can use an elixir to remove your vagina while you have something in it (as in- by drinking the potion during sex),
		 which does not stop the penetration (though it does make the game reference what I assume to be an empty string, because description text is still printed but with the word for the pussy missing).
		  You might even be able to get pregnant from it, though I haven't managed to pull that off (I got the "might be pregnant" box to appear, but the 5 times I tried it I didn't get knocked up).
	
	Can unequip Rose's clothing in sex
	
	Add makeup wipes
	Add nailpolish remover
	Add freckles
	lipstick: different colored bottom and top lips
	
	a pink slave collar that increased fertility
		glowing pink
	
	post sex NPC inventory interaction still on the to do list
	
	
	It worked once but now for some unknown reason enchanting is no longer working at all
	
	NPCs not listening to requests (Brax always anal)
	
	Ralph does nothing if ask for discount too early x_x
	Okay he did it after blowing him to at least 30
	maybe the if statement that displays the 'big discount' button is borked? Or maybe it doesnt have one. At any rate it should only pop up when it'll actually succeed/do something
	
	
	I'll be adding more orgasm options (including NPC using ass/pussy-to-mouth) both this and next week! :3

	And I'm also planning on expanding those harpy punishment scenes to be a little longer and more interactive in the future. ^^
	
	I'll also add that condom-force-feeding action for NPCs at some point soon, thanks for the suggestion!
	
	
	I dropped stolen panties (with almost full inventiory) and game just closed. Fucking hell.
	
	Despite putting in the settings, a 0-spawn rate for males, when I come across my kids in alleyways, most of them appear as males.
	
	I was considering using stamina in sex to determine for how long you can keep on going (with the option to drink stamina restoration potions for those that want to get to 60 orgasms).
	 disassociate the state of your hymen from your virginity, so that once you've lost it, you can never be a true virgin again
	
	fingers in partner's mouth, and tongue actions
	
	when I imported my old character, it reset all the gender preferences to a strange selection like 100% towards male characters and 100% towards futanari, with everything else 0%.
	
	
	
	 Also, I wound up with 2 of Brittany's lollipop after fighting her, doing nothing, then having sex. 
	
	
	Combine gender prefs and pronouns
	
	turning off shemale encounters in "gender preferences" tab - doesn't prevent them from appearing in game
	
	
	
	could you make some "lore" explanation for protagonist's ability to use arcane energy for chosing fetishes
	
	
	Oh wanted to ask, have you ever got around to changing the description of the virginity and lusty maiden perks? While she doesn't want to ever lose it, she has nothing wrong with using her pussy to seduce, tease and drive her friends/foes with lust ;D Cock tease and spreads come to mind.

	Also, any follow ups on already exposed states pre combat/sex? Being an exhibitionist virtually removes all npc reactions from the game, which is wierd!
	
	
	Forced TF:
	-Height: very often go below 5 feet, is there that many who like midgets?:P
	-hair:...or repunzels? Very often get floor length hair and never anything less then backlength. Figure common values should be shoulder to back length, with others being outliers.
	-Breasts: Never target below c cup, and even in non breastfetish/cowmorph scenarios often get DD+. I'm figuring common values should be B-C and even A be allowed.
	-Cow morphs: Get if they desire female and your male they will continue to try to transform horns with no luck. Also, should 4 titted teats on breasts and/or udders be a tf possibility?
	-I think with forced tf on and/or tf fetish, if you aren't the desired gender of npc they should transform you when you are defeated rather than just robbing you.
	-I'm wondering if there is a way to fine tune color combinations that happen. I understand this is hard with a random system, but fairly often you get unatural combinations or something that would make a color coordinator cry. IE: Blond fur, ginger hair, brown eyes. Perhaps have some "presets" that you have a medium chance of being assigned?

	Also (probably not a bug)

	Gynephilic females will not transform you. Each and every time there is a gynephilic female, they will be criminals for enslavement.

	Seems to be an order of operations issue, probably on my end... Stripped a criminal, stole her clothes, had sex, before sex scene ended put on the collar, and when I went to pick her up she had an inventory full of clothes... Only time I've had that happen...  I just started collaring them before sexing them to prevent it...

	The issue with NPCs removing bras might be related to the Maid set. It only seems to happen when I have that set equipped
	
	Non con fetishist NPCs don't seem to rape you...
		They had the right orientation
		They put up a resistance and make you rape them if you win even if they have an orientation that likes you. But that makes sense cause of thier fetish they want to be raped/ struggle during sex.
			But As it is currently they don't seem to be willing to be on the dominant end of a rape scense which contradicts the fetishes's current description text.
			It might perhaps be a good idea to split up the Non con fetish anyways though. Into giving and recieving versions.
	
	the dialogue boxes are not automatically scrolling to the bottom anymore
	This is sex scene dialogue, it won't scroll down automatically when a new message appears
	 sometimes scrolls down, and sometimes doesn't
	
	There seems to be a bug with scrolling on the main screen during large scenes.  Intermittently it will not scroll to new text.  EDIT: This may have been confusion over especially long text sequences.  I have not had any issues for awhile now
	Hmm, the default screen width isn't enough to make the +/- buttons work right on the level-up screen
	
	Because hands are not tracked separately, fluids can travel from one hand to the other in unexpected ways.  If a partner fingers your ass, then somehow lubricates their other fingers while still fingering you, your ass will also become lubricated
	
	Forgot to ping you earlier and editing it in doesn't help but giving an NPC the collar then equipping it to them doesn't make them your slave. Probably would have liked that before the release but yeah I have memory that looks worse than swiss cheese
	
	The AI seems to be fixating on chest-play when in the kneeling position for some reason.  Oral and oral performers are more into paizuri/naizuri than breast and breast lovers.  There is possibly also too much of a focus on anal fingering, but this may be due to a lack of other options
	
	in the characters present screen if you mouse over the closing the NPC is wearing it only shows you what slot it is not what the item is
	
	Scarlett refuses to take a vixen's virility. I don't think slaves should get to do that
	
	Also, she's still replacing her maid's dress
	I  gave Scarlett a maid dress and had sex with her, when I checked her inventory she was back in the clothes she had when she owned the slave shop
	
	
	
	Remove jinxed clothing from slave
	
	restore the option to acces an NPC's inventory right after sex
	
	Also I think I pinned it down with that odd feeling. The map doesn't seem to have border, infact almost nothing seems to except the button panel and the event log.
	
	Sometimes NPCs will ignore an article of clothing during a scene. NPCs seem to not like removing my character's bra for whatever reason.

	Also, right now, everyone has a species-preference. -may- want to make it so that some folk don't care much about species and only about body-shape/sex
	Make gender preferences for NPC's forced TFs settable
	
	Add paizuri for multi-breasts
	
	Maybe a non-furry version of forced TF would change the character's body type and such. For example, changing femininity, breast size, etc.
	I think bimbofication and sissification are common, fur-free, fetishes on TFgamessite. So maybe the human-only forced TFs could do something like that?
	
	Now, one other thought, maybe have fetishes figure in a little bit for what gear they end up with?
		Not for normal peps, but when deciding whether to be a herm or off-gender sex.
		If someone has a cum feitsh or receiving cock feitsh, they should probably prefer a partner with a cock.
		If they have impregnation fetishes, it would make sense for them to prefer a partner with a vagina.
		This could actually be tested after the random roll has been done, and adjusts the result then.
		That will save a fair bit of coding work.

	If a character has the non-consent fetish, you should remove the arousal gain penalty from resisting sex. You might even gain extra arousal
	NPCs with the non-con fetish always resist
	So a sadistic character will gain more arousal from a resisting partner and a non-con fetishist would gain extra arousal while resisting instead of having a penalty.
	
	Firstly, you could change the description of the Non-con fetish to only include being raped, but not necessarily raping others. 
	Then, you can expand the sadism fetish to include raping others. Alternatively, you could also make a second red boardered "dominant" version of the Non-con fetish.
	Also, you could have the "resist" action only decrease the character's arousal if they don't have the noncon fetish. I have no idea where this is done in the code however but if you can find where to stick it, a little if statement would probably do

	Possible bug with identifying working with stacks instead of single items (confirming that there is a bug here would be real nice because then I could fix it)
	
	Known possible inventory related improvements which I haven't applied yet because... ehhh lemme know if you want these:
	
	The bottom border of the item overlay with effects grows as the effects list goes on, this could get normalized
	Buy back says "Vendor will sell it to you for $ x.", could be "Vendor will let you buy it back for $ x."

	After defeating my character, the succubi just finger their nipples and tail-fuck themselves to completion a lot of the time. Is there a way to disable this?
	
	Hey, tailpegging is super broken, it doesn't properly check to see if the player actually has a tail.
	
	The only bug i have found is when you use transformative enchantments on multiple (maybe single, haven't tested) breasts, specifically trying to grow the nipple and areola size that it keeps switching between 'getting larger' and 'shrinking' when all were enchanted to be Major Boost

	Genderless mound" on dolls should probably be, "sexless mound".  Genitals don't really have a gender, so to speak, and another word for genitals is sex.(edited)
[23:01] DarkMaster: That mound being exposed does not trigger the exposed condition, may not be a bug but exposing it would still be public indecency and perhaps embracing
	
	I encountered a possible bug... I asked Ralph for the big discount, and now every move he does... is a lack thereof. he won't move at all. if it helps pin down the bug, it's durring a storm, and I already have a 25% discount. I don't know if either of those have to do with this.

add in part-specific colouring

Not sure if it's been pointed out but when I choose "slut" as a starting choice, it doesn't work. In fact, if I choose it, go back, and choose another (e.g average), I end up with a mix between slut and whatever other I chose!

1. The latest preview did not find my exported character from 1.83 but from the HF
2. The hair/skin/eye colors got changed all to brown, possibly due to color change in code

Caused by being tired for 4 hours (ie awake for over 16 hours in a row), gives -5 strength -5 stamina and -5 willpower. Also make rest take 8 instead of 4 hours (succubi need to sleep too!).
	
	Minor bug report: Gaining more testicles seems to be bugged. I created a potion to take a character from 2 to 8, and I got this message 3 times:"A tingling feeling spreads down into your testicles, and you let out a little cry as you feel some of them shrinking away and disappearing.

4) New fetish: Chastity fetish. Frustrated debuff (-10 spell damage -50 willpower resist) becomes chaste (+50 stamina, -25 willpower resist)

You could make a new file full of "clothing tag" enums. The tags would describe clothes. For example, "revealing", "protective", "modest", "bondage" etc. Each item could have multiple tags. When the enchantment on the item is randomly generated, the tags would influence what types of enchantments are randomly selected.

You could do different things with this system: 
- maybe certain enchantments are only available for items with the right tags. 
(eg: revealing clothes like miniskirts might be the only ones to give a bonus to willpower damage.)

- maybe certain enchantments might be impossible for items with the wrong tags.
(eg: revealing clothes might never give bonuses to physical damage resistance.)

- maybe enchantments are still randomly generated but if a piece of clothing has a certain tag it might automatically get a stronger bonus. 
(eg: a physical damage resistance enchant on protective clothing would give a much higher bonus than a physical damage resistance enchant on revealing clothing.)



After a few moments, you're left with eight balls."
When it should be an indication that I'm gaining testicles, and the three messages should have given different amounts (first should have said 4, second 6, third 8).
	
	
	Minor bug report: Gaining more testicles seems to be bugged. I created a potion to take a character from 2 to 8, and I got this message 3 times:"A tingling feeling spreads down into your testicles, and you let out a little cry as you feel some of them shrinking away and disappearing.

After a few moments, you're left with eight balls."

	Hmm. Being pushed down into submissive cowgirl by a gynephilic victor that believes you to be female seems like it is probably not intended behavior?
	
	Also, there seems to be a continuity issue with NPCs' fetishes and their physical traits, such as a large number of girls I'm running into that like giving anal despite not actually having a penis themselves or guys who like being impregnated.
	
	my characters completely dry asshole is now being lubricated for some reason despite it being dry. It also only shows up when arousal is above 80
	
	1. The foot revamp where you have three foot styles (Talon, Foot/paw, Hoof) which is then used to figure blocked feet for clothing.
	 2. cloaca descriptions so that any avian/reptiles are given proper descriptions, as they look doll-like most of the time. 
	
	
	-Default to a different hair colour than white.
	-Body hair should default to the same colour as head hair, with a setting that specifically says, "Same as hair".
	  Once the game starts, then it makes sense to have that be set to a normal hair colour for transformation effects.  If it isn't already, body hair colour should probably also be fur colour.
	[21:41] DarkMaster: .
	Fetish suggestions: 
	-If a specific content type is completely disabled (like incest and non-con), then that fetish should not appear on the fetish screen at all and characters should not spawn with that fetish.
	-Content types that are partially disabled (like forced TFs) should either prevent the PC from being able to take those kinks, or prevent random NPCs from spawning with them, depending on what part is actually disabled.
	-Additionally/alternatively, enabling specific content partially unlocks that content (such as allowing the Lilaya scene and Brax's forced TF) but taking the fetish makes the content more likely (kids spawning in alleys and random NPCs TFing the player).
	
	
	Equals and HashCode *should* be ok for Abstract Clothing, Item, and Weapon types, but maybe make sure.
	
	GATE HAIR PROPERLY FOR TFS
	
	Gate obesity
	
	Add facesitting position, with descriptions from SABracSubCowgirl
	
	Good point, I'll add fuckable nipples (and urethras) behind option gates.
	
	so apparently if you're sitting on Brax's face when he cums, the system thinks that you were sitting on his dick
		just confirmed it does the same thing with vaginal
		doesn't count as penetration for the sake of virginity though, as my character is a """pure""" virgin and did not get broken by it
	
	exhibitionist clothing equipping
	
	remove all clothing button? or a strip button?
	
	So apparently if you import a character over from a new version and go through the prologue, then knock up Lilaya in the first encounter it won't progress since it ends differently.
		Going in for tests again lets you bone irregardless, but it won't let you do other sidequests that involve her, or progress the story along. I take it there's a catch missing, or that knocking her up isn't fully implemented?
	
	Also she stood there behind me sucking on her tail the whole time and did not even fuck me it was like finger sucking all over again

	(I think I fixed, but check)
	Seems to be a bug where the second time a character gives birth the "pass out" button (and its knocked out equivalent) doesnt progress the scene, leaving you stuck there.
	
	a crash bug, if in you'r room, you put objects, and have to much objects, if you take all and don't have engout space in your invotory, the game crash
	
	 I think something's up with gender pronouns in the latest hotfix. Either that or traps are no longer called traps and are just called "Man" regardless of settings or feminity level.
	  Not sure, I'm out of town so haven't really been able to give this release a good stress test, hence why I'm not even signed in.

	Maybe the change to starting body breast size for androgynous males did that since they no start with a flat chest?
	 Either way, manually modifying the custom pronouns for players seems to change nothing, which might be a bigger problem if it's just not working at all like it should. Just FYI.
	
	found a bug that happens when you get pregnant from brax and then feminize him you get stuck in delivering scene
		it actually gets stuck because father is bree/brandi: Stanley Brandisson (horse-morph) Father:Brandi Mother:Carlos
	
	you fixed the player getting the more severe arcane storm effect but now while the player is outside it does not give any indicator that the arcane storm is happening at all in the status screen, although it does show you arcane storm protected status while indoors
	
	It appears that the chasing squirrels book is still on the drop table for random encounters even if you have already read it
	
	it seems dying items acts etremely oddly with stacks
	i dyed a stack of 2 rose gold collars platinum and then it showed i had 2 platinum collars but i had only used 1 dye brush then when i dyed another item it updated to 1 platinum collar and one rose gold collar
	Finally when i dyed the second rose gold collar platinum it did not stack with the other one immediatly
	Actually its just not letting me select it period
	Ok if i mess with the stacks a bunch it fixes it but that code definitely needs sanity checks
	Yeah so if you dye an item that is stackable to the same colour as another in your inventory it breaks one of them preventing you from interacting with it directly
	
	the "Report back" option doesn't disappear after reporting back once, although it doesn't do anything
	
	Is how good you are at a blowjob supposed to increase? Because mine doesn't. Ever. Maybe my guy is just that bad lol.
	
	Unsure if intended behavior or not, but typing in the name of a save, then hitting the enter key instead of pushing the save button will cause the main UI window to blank and the program to do nothing.
	  Expected behavior would assume that hitting enter would be the same as pushing the save button, but that may be hard to code in.
	
	: I think wearing a chastity belt and then getting fucked by brax while wearing pants has him perpetually masturbate instead of fuck you
	"I'm going to fuck you senseless" -> masturbates
	and he wont pull down pants, so the moment you do it, he actually fucks you
	
	brax loop for letting him impregnate you and then feminize him (gets looped in delivering scene)

	Pure Virgin NPCs should probably not beg you to fuck them in the puss if you're teasing it with your cock.
	
	 Impregnated Bree, then bimbo'd her and pregged her again
		Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but either way this happened:
			[two ongoing pregnancies for Brax, pregnancy stage: pregnant]
	
	How about a derived fetish from exhibition and masochism?
		Humiliation Fetish?
	
	Partner not making a move when sub and getting dom-oral
	
	encountered a problem with text saying I had a Knot even though I have a human penis. Didn't happen often, only saw it once or twice, think it only happened when I was with Dog-girls too
	
	Similar buffs could extend to things like anal creampie for anal fetishists, pregnancy for pregnancy fetishists.  Some fetish buffs would have to be applied after certain acts are done, such as causing a pregnancy chance for seeders.
		Would probably make sense to have that replace the exp boost from taking virginities.
		(Taking virgiinities would give a bigger/different buff than seeding would.)
	
	add an action to ask for them to keep going in sex
	
	Tantric Fetish
		It would encourage a partner to keep on going for more orgasns/ it could give you an extra arcane esscence for each orgasm you and your partner have.
		 get rested bonuses from having sex for a long time from the meditative/spiritual aspect of tantra

	Vaginal wetness to determine squirting
	
	That's a good point about your phone... Once I expand the character creation screen, I'm going to let you choose your starting clothes, so I'll rework that part of the intro then (so that you keep your clothes). ^^
	I'm going to be adding conversation actions with Lilaya soon, and I'll add one for talking about your phone, good idea!
	Oh, and I'll probably expand the generic NPC encounters so that they try to run away if they've lost to you several times.
	
	
	UPDATE Lilaya & Kate SCENES:
		Getting a lot of game-halting bugs when trying to use the finger yourself command when doin the do with Lilaya
		Some embedded buttons are completely missing
	
	some descriptions could maybe change according to your characters orientation because it seems strange that an androphilic character stares and gulps at for example the stylist or other female assets
	
	if you have a tail and either suck it or self-tail peg, in the selfie tab the first time is given to your partner.
	
	If I select "Orgasm" instead of "Stay in position", I won't get a chance of pregnancy, I won't get pregnant, and I won't even get a creampie status, even though the flavor text says I got hella cum in my 100% fertility vagina.
	
	Please deal with the terrible finger sucking once and for all
	
	succubus is still not using her cock; add a preference for cock actions to her
	
	When you have the observant perk and examine someone, it shows what they are, but it also shows what they look like. The two statements are useful, but how they're blended (or, rather, not) can be rather jarring.
	
	Might be useful to be able to hide one or more sections in the pregnancy stats (ongoing pregs / completed pregs / offsprings list), because after having too many pregs with the seeder fetish, that page became quite long
	
	 i just got into a bug where the wolf futa i was having sex with pulled out just as her arousal reached 100 and its staying in an infinite loop where she is doing nothing
	 I had to choose a penetrative action in order to trigger the scene to end

	Quicksave_somechar or Quicksave_otherchar
	
	Minor NPCs should be complying with requests, but I'll add some reactions for them to make that clear
	
	One of the NPC's quotes for a top-heavy PC is something like "How much Bubble Milk have you been drinking?!" Since bubble milk is no longer an item in the game, I feel that this quote has been overlooked.
	
	The gender detection is terrible ^^
	
	slightly change the flavour text for the Lusty Maiden stuff (to say they use pussy, but no penetration)
	
	The ability to have NPCs suck on your tail
	(furry tail option)
	
	I've always wished more games with combat would implement more sadomasochism stuff. I'm thinking something like, the less health you have, the harder you hit.
	 Maybe a perk of some kind. Could be health based or seduction based. Maybe a fetish like the more aroused you are, the more you arouse others.
	Also, attacks and teases that deal recoil damage of some kind. Like a really powerful tease that arouses the user or an attack that's self-inflicted but deals a lot of damage or arousal to the opponent. Something like that.
	Generally combat stuff that says "I will kill you by beating myself up!"
	I'm thinking something like Double Edge, where you take recoil damage, or Counter, where you deal twice the amount of damage you took, except with the emphasis being not on
	 "I was reckless and hurt myself but at least I beat you up" and more of "Getting hurt IS my attack!"
	 I don't want getting hurt to be a side effect of why I win, I want getting hurt to BE why I win
	
	
	 I'm still of the opinion that for whatever the next iteration of the character development system is, a system similar to D&D should be investigated.
	  One where your "Core" attributes are actuall core, and extremely difficult to alter(and probably tied to the TF's),
	   while the incremental changes that happen upon leveling up apply only to things that are safe to have increase infinitely(like the ability to overcome/resist specific interactions)
	
	cowboy hat
	Belt top... literally wearing a belt that coveres no more than the nipples

	Interruptions with bimbo speak (handle '-')
	
	penis, anal, nipple, oral virginity fetishes
	
	When you're having a scene with Lilaya, sometimes a button will not respond, and if you switch button pages and return, the button is missing
		For me, it was during the first scene with Lilaya. I tried to finger self, and it did not appear to respond, so I switched pages, came back and the button was gone.
		 I tried some other things to get the scene to progress, then other buttons stopped responding, like feel breasts, etc, during the scene.
		Once the scene progressed, things would return to normal for a while. I have not noticed the issue with Kate or random NPCs though.
		: I tried other actions later in the scene, and some buttons would just not respond, and flipping through the pages would make those unresponsive buttons vanish until the scene progressed.
	
	When I exported my character it was a pregnant herm, and import screen and selfie after importing show the same as well as I have the pregnant status effect.
	 However when I drank a "mother's milk" to speed it along so I could get preggers again, the potion dialog said nothing happened since I wasn't pregnant and the status timer didn't budge from the time left in that stage. 
	 That's as far as I got last night before passing out tho; Haven't tried receiving vaginal sex yet to see what happens.
	
	
	I've been using the masturbation fetish for those sort of options, but that doesn't really make much sense. I'll add a fetish for 'manual stimulation' (both for giving and receiving)
	
	While the shop is renamed 'Pix's Playground', the fast-travel button at the mall entrance is still 'City Gym'.
	
	Since v0.1.81 at least, there's a bug involving the standing/sitting NPC sex scenes (Lilaya, Kate), where trying to do self-penetration (pink-text) actions will lock up the dialogue.
	 Specifically, the scene won't progress and the only working button is 'Use item'; clicking on it will advance arousal but returning to the main screen doesn't advance the scene, and some of the options disappear.
	  It seems to happen when the partner is also self-penetrating, although from what I've been able to test, the logic isn't consistent (Lilaya doing all three - mouth, nipples, tail - doesn't cause the lock-up, but any one on its own does).
	   So far as I've tested, this does NOT happen with street NPCs, and normal intercourse is unaffected. I'm not familiar with Java so I haven't looked at the source code, but it seems to be unique to these characters' arrangement.
	
	
	Multi-breast option for unique NPCs
	
	Add unique scene for succubus taking virginity with tail.
	
	Combine potion effects!
	
	Add better reaction dialogue for:
		Starting sex with areas exposed
		Revealing areas while resisting
	
	Special daughter code :3
	
	veils
	
	If the system generates an NPC with a derived fetish (which is actually good) it should make sure they have the prerequisite fetishes too
		So basically grab from hat; if selections have prereqs, add those too
	
	I took the virgin trait, then I took my own virginity with my tail.  The game was not prepared.  It said the succubus I was having sex with did it.
	
	save game in sex/combat
	
	
	An easier fix for the moment might be to make it harder to level up.  You do seem to climb way faster than you should.  Especially since the game basically starts you off at level 2 if you just go to the lab.
	
	Clothing enchanting
		Maybe locks a character to a certain TF
		Or makes them always use a certain pace
	
	Used condom mechanics (enchant + impregnate)
	
	+ tit fucking
	+ hotdogging
	+ thigh sex
	
	voyeur fetish as a partner to exhibitionist
	
	character rework, ask the player if non-con is to be on or off. Same with TF
	
	When you explore the harpy nests after you finish the quest you wont find anything instead the look for trouble command is what you use so having the explore command there is redundant and possibly confusing
	
	It'd be even better if their scaling could be made dynamic based on time, and for the player's children the level of both parents at conception.
	
	Ralph's scenes
		The turn after I pushed us onto the brink of a mutual orgasm, a customer arrived. After clicking "Mutual Orgasm", I got the text for my climax, followed by the "part of your discount was offered to the customer" text,
		 followed by "you stayed quiet, they didn't find out you were there!" Then after the customer leaves Ralph's climax text hits. Then he offers me the full 25% discount. When I get back to the shop menu, however, it's listed as 20%.
	
	
	5) Also on the Non-Con Train, the description of your partner in the "Step Back" screen after the dirty deed has been done is also positive.
	 After 12 orgasms, the formerly Pure Virgin Non-Con partner shouldn't be "thoroughly satisfied because you gave them what they wanted."
	  Without getting too brutal you could say something along the lines of "Your reluctant partner lay panting in your combined fluids, their trembles a mark of their attempted resistance and ultimate failure to do so" or something. 
	
	It seems that hitting enter after typing in a name on the save game screen glitches it out.  You need to click off of the text box.
	
	Pix multi-breast
	
	You cant get rid of harpies although i have not tested after the harpy quest is finished
	
	Buy all not showing up?
	
	Tooltip persisting on window switch
	
	Regarding my suggestion of changing stats to different names (so you don't have strength or fitness, which don't have any bearing on the player's appearance), coming up with names for new stats that make sense was fairly easy.
	  They can be things like 'force of personality' or 'self-control', things which make a lot of sense to influence how good you are with magic and how strong your aura is.
	    That gives you a set of combat stats that then don't have any bearing on your appearance.
	The snag I actually ran into is actually the special attacks that various body types and transformations give you, abilities that are obviously not derived from magic at all.
	  It wouldn't be too hard to change enemies up so that they don't attack you directly, instead using magic to hit your aura, but those special attacks would have to be completely
	   redone since it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for claws to give you a new spell that you can't get otherwise.
	
	
	In the same way dicks will be getting flags it would be nice if pussies could also get a couple more variables for stuff like labia size/shape. It would also be nice if their pubic hair and it's potential styling were a flag rather than a matter of race. 
	Similarly it would be nice if nipples could get a bit more details like size, shape, state of inversion. Areola size/shape. 
	( For example it would be hot if some nipples started inverted but then 'pop' out once they get stiff from arousal.
	 While some, especially fuckable nipples should probably stay inverted regardless of arousal. As for Areola being to make them puffy separately from the nipples base size would be neat.)
	
	Brax dom not using proper actions?
	
	
	implement a sort of fetish-inheritance system
	
	-Child race is determined as one of the parent's dominant race (50/50 of player or partner's race, perks determine if player is more or less likely)
	-Child's furriness rating is determined to be something between the parent's furriness (random, average, or based on player choice of which)
	-Furriness is same as furry preference settings.
	-Humans are essentially all races with no furriness, so their race is ignored when determining what race the child will have (only if the child's furriness is 0 are they human)
	-The gender of the child is determined based on a mix of the natural birth rates for their race and the player's gender preferences, based on a setting chosen in the gender preference menu.  The options are:
	--All natural births (children are always the natural genders, ex: humans are 50% male and 50% female, harpies are 50% traps and 50% female)
	--Some preferred births (children are mostly natural genders, with a 10-33% chance to instead follow the player's gender preferences)
	--Natural preferred births (children are always natural genders, but will follow the player's gender preferences when possible, ex: if either male or female are enabled, the split will be based on the players gender preferences, otherwise it's the default)
	--All preferred births (children's genders are always based on the player's gender preferences)
	
	{
	Gender prefs aren't being applied to offspring.
	-Natural birth only (all children are born based on their race's natural birth rates only, human 50% male/50% female, harpy 50% trap / 50% female)
	-Rare unusual births (most children are born with natural genders, but unusual ones have a small chance to trigger)
	-Natural preferred births (all children are born with natural birth genders, but will respect the player's gender preferences when possible)
	-All births preferred (children will use the player's gender preference sheet)

	cum onto face/breasts/stomach/pussy/ass/back
	
	At this point I would probably suggest giving some category tabs to other stores than just Nyan's. 
		Vicky's for example is getting kinda cramped with the new additions, and will get even more so if things keep going at this rate.
	
	AI are trying to remove all pen before orgasming? :s
		": Diana basically removed my finger from her ass, pulled off my dick from her throat, stopped fingering my pussy and then came"
	
	
	a decently game-breaking bug: Diana has an infinity loop where she stops the kissing action the PC initiated as the dom. When selected again she does it again to no end. So kissing is bugged for her atm.
	It seems Lexi has the same problem as Diana, and the issue is not an infinite loop but they just constantly stop kissing
Also noticed the Stop partner self action option disappears.
	
	Also, Face/Back to wall options do not become available until the selection of another position. I checked with doggy style.
	
	equipping items with global resist doesn't actually buff any of your resistances
	
	 Succubus attacker scene, submissive (no fight), with a new character (level 3): in 69, she struggles to blow my character (stretching her mouth for like 5+ turns); she then forces me to blow her,
	  and despite i have a standard mouth, there is no streching at all (for a 19 inch demonic cock...); am I naturally talented ? :LTmouth:
 Oh and despite being horny as fuck, and stating clearly she's going to fuck me, even if I request anal and she puts me in an anal-enabling position, she never goes for it, too busy stimulating herself with her various... tools
	
	Regarding Ralph's scene: i tried twice to ask for a big discount asap; it stops the sucking scene, Ralph says or does nothing (except stopping getting sucked), and... that's all. From there, the only available options are Wait
	 (Ralph does nothing either) / Calm down / Starting sucking (again; seems to work, except the big discount option isn't there anymore). More or less default male human character.
	( I think you need to get him suitably aroused first, 60 arousal or so?)
	Okay, this is only a matter of arousal; I tested with 40+ arousal on Ralph but with clothes on, and it works (he pulls everything himself when i select the option)
	
	
	the assaulting succubus doesn't have her racial trait, despite being Greater (and fully Demonic)
	
	Change sex actions into categories:
		[pen actions]
		[orifice actions]
	
	Saving in combat is causing a bug where if you reload, the enemy retains their lost health from before the load
	
	So apparently if you start as Androgynous Woman on the body, then chose your pronoun prefernce to be male, it ends up in that scenario:
		"You are a female man."
	
	
	Quests really need sorting out
	
	Fix Brax|bree options
	
	
	
	Mother's milk text, when using on an NPC, says "You eagerly gulp down the rich, creamy..."
	
	Stats panel is still creeping down and pushing your partners stats into unreadability during sex.
	Additional the masochism fetish doesn't seem to be working properly. was fighting an NPC and seduced them down to 8 points of willpower and punched them for 20 points of health damage and she took no willpower damage
	
	
	 think I found a bug, in the alley I have a wolf-girl like mark or stay in the place, then press the explore button several times so can she show up, but instead of the wolf-girl it was dog-girl
	 
	
	Far too many oral virgins
	
	To enable things like slime cat-girls:
	: Body part "materials"
		EG: "Flesh" is the default part "material"
		But later you could add "Slime"
		"Rock" for like golem arms
		"Phantom" for telekenetic parts
		"Energy" for elemental parts like a Fire elemental
		"ghostly" for ghost parts
	
	Sex UI to show pen types
		Also just have one 'fetishes' icon
	
	Missionary (mating press if have impregnation fetish)
	
	 the game still says for npcs that wear fishnet top + cupless bra that I don't know their nipples (No exposed status effect)
	  It says her large boobs are now exposed
	You've never seen her naked chest, so you don't know what her nipples look like
	
	AI in sex:
		Horse boy pulled out at 98 arousal in doggy-style
	
	
	I guess if it's in the player's hands (Like an option saying 'BAD END: Submit totally to Brax.'), then bad ends could be ok.
	
	furry tail option
		Well, I don't think it will be included by default, due to my concerns with how it would feel, but I could add a toggle in the options menu to enable it. It wouldn't really be any extra work to do that, and I guess everyone is happy then.
	
	Yeah, I'll add some more variation so that more NPCs resist if you have non-con turned on. At the moment, it's just virgins or NPCs that aren't attracted to you who will resist. ^^
	
	Add some more speech during sex, like little unique lines to say based on what fetishes they have.
	
	add a cryptic "on loan from Merle" note to Vicky
	
	make 'litter size increase' a stat to be manipulated like all the others
	
	Speaking of finger sucking, is it possible to make other people suck your fingers? I know you can stick your fingers everywhere else.
	
	Fetishes besides exhibitionist (and crossdresser) should be taken into account for clothing choices, too. Like a buttslut should be more likely to wear backless panties. And a pure virgin should probably never wear anything crotchless
	
	Add some variation to clothing removal priorities
		I might make some NPCs only interested in starting penetration as soon as possible
		Anal fetishists should only care about revealing ass (split receiving and giving fetishes)
	
	I should add 'storm' status effect to the sex screen, so it's clear that the storm is having an influence on them.
		Pure virgin 'Tease her pussy' -> her response is begging to be fucked x_x (Due to storm though???)
	
	Orgasm actions are sometimes defaulting to the special ones, sometimes the default ones :s
		MUTUAL ORGASMS!!!
		deepthroat during her orgasm, "you feel her insider slighlty twitching as her body shakes from her orgasm"
	
	harpy begs for sex after fight
	Than it proceeds like its rape
	Issue linked with Pure Virgin fetish/effect?
	
	The dog-girl grins at you as your no breasts are revealed, "Aww, are you trying to become a girl?"
	
	I sometimes couldent deepthroat cum intop a harpy (no mutual orgasm is the cause)
	
	 put some rudimentary java install instructions on the blog, followed by instructions on how to launch jar files via the command line.
	
	Harpy fingering :s
	
	You're right, it does remove the possibility of female NPCs using oral/masturbation actions in those positions. I didn't quite think that one through, and will most likely revert it in the next update. ^^

	I'm also planning on completely revamping the character creation screen soon (as well as adding 'penis virginity'), and once I do that there will be a lot more starting traits to choose from! ^^
	
	Seems cock size and cum production can be boostet infinitely while descriptions seem to cap out at stallion-sized/extreme, not sure if intentional or not.
	 Cum production also doesn't seem to have any effect when you're on the receiving end of the cock, in neither dominant nor submissive scenes that I've tested, not sure if a bug or just incomplete.
	  Deepthroating also doesn't seem to stretch your throat at all. As an aside on blowjobs there should probably also be an option to cum in someone's mouth,
	   or have them cum in yours and then spit/swallow/play around with it, etc as desired, possibly with a rough action to force swallow.
	 20% human encounters also seems to be broken, didn't get one human on that setting, but it might just have been RNG fucking with me.
	
	Also, possible bug but may also be intended: With the Exhibition Fetish enabled, wearing a pair of backless panties adds the +12 Willpower damage status, but does not remove the +4 variant as is expected.
	 Shifting them aside and removing them properly removes the +4 status, leaving the +12 variant in play, but replacing or re-equipping them produces the previous results of both statuses being applied.
	  Checked with my stats page to confirm that it is in fact affecting my character in this manner and the math checks out and is consistent with the statuses being simultaneously applied.
	   Key note is that the same results do NOT occur when using other types of clothing that blocks view of the genitals.
	 This was tested and remains consistent with both male and female characters. Saves used were created with current build, 0.1.81.
	 + assless chaps
	
	
	fondling balls is associated to oral fetish
	
	Pix scene behind non-con
	
	: I could add a 1-turn check so that if you've displaced that clothing, they prefer to displace on that same turn
	: I should also add a 'forbid self-clothing interaction' action
	
	exhibitionists wearing overbust corsets
	
	Could be fun to play around with that number. Like fetish affecting the outcome or how you do the combat maybe?
		"weakness exploited + 2 essance"
	
	wouldent it be better to change the "your naturel dog-morph's ears colour is black"
		To "your naturel dog-morph's fur colour is black"
	change the descriptions to say "You now have a dog-like tail, covered in black fur."
	
	are the foodstuffs supposed to have a transformation effect before they're made into potions or what because Rose warns you to be careful of everything you do unless you want to turn into a catgirl.
		hint at encahnting system
	
	: I should add 'forbid partner' to consensual scenes, to give you more control
	
	the game considers me penetrating Lilaya as me getting fucked by her in the dirty talk: "Don't stop! Fuck me!"
	
	use the matriarch items on NPCs
	
	1) Any harpy you encountered before making it safe will be impossible to meet their saved icon will remain on the area but they can't be encountered.
	2) After making the nest safe it is impossible to encounter the same harpy twice. Her icon remains but when you click look for trouble a completely different harpy shows ups.
	
	
	Brax sex ended with pregnancy warning. Last action was orgasm while getting licked.
	
	Dual strike text doesn't take into account misses
	
	Enemies seem to add more acceseries every time i encounter them
		they just keep putting on more clothes

	Could there be a fun stat for how many undies or jewelry stolen?
	
	also a rape fetish for NPCs that makes them always resist
	
	Pix has multiple rows of breats despite the fact that I've turned off the multi-breast setting. Is this because she's a pregenerated character?
	
	It'd be interesting if perks like cum addict and nympho had a bonus if they were satisfied recently, and a penalty if you've gone a while without cum/sex
	
	After giving a random npc mother's milk, the dialogue description's 3rd paragraph is addressing the PC instead of the npc: "You eagerly... overwhelms your senses... Before you know...." Etc.
	
	Mother's milk for kate
	
	
	Importer is deleting core stats
	
	
	AI:
		1. An enemy with the Dominant personality just shouted Dirty Talk at me. Not even finger sucking or anything else, just that.
	
		Even after giving permission, the NPC doesn’t help with stripping of clothing. They don’t even take their own clothes off. Related to this, NPCs are still not taking off their bottoms generally speaking, not related to the permission.
	
	
	
	Cum fetish needs variation for nympho.
		Timings for punishments.
			
			
	Add player sexuality as part of the gender preferences option menu
	
	font size: large is causing the boxes in furry preferences to not fit the text.
	
	Not sure if this is a bug, but since Brax became repeatable he now prefers anal without the Anal fetish.  In 10+ attempts I have never had him take my character vaginally regardless of whether I was a futa or pure female.
	
	
	Need to change onVirginity loss to take into account NPC and their penetration type.
	
	by the way Innoxia, were you aware that for some reason every time I take an enemy, they now lean against my tiny/large breasts?! I'm playing male this play through, no breasteses in selfie, yet lol
		as in sexebrating my victory over an opponent
	
	Random potion/elixirs as drops
	
	futa harpies a possibility.
	
	Oh and another bug, the "allow clothes" and "forbid self actions" buttons don't appear at the very start of sex with the matriarchs, you have to do certain actions first.
	
	During sex, If an NPC (Any race) removes their top I don't know what their breasts look like, but if I remove their top I do know what their breasts look like.
	

	
	Also, "stroke cock" only works during sex with Brax now, and not in any other sexual encounter.
	Btw, Innoxia, stroke cock is still not working.
	Also, "stroke your cock" during sex doesn't work.
	
	Skin/eye/hair/fur colour groups
	
	Pregnant demons to grow penis? Doesn't this break pregnancy? :o
	 
	 Nah, sex again afterwards with a normal creampie caused the 'there's a chance she'll get pregnant' message.
	  If there was a prior valid creampie, it would have given the 'if she wasn't already pregnant, there's a chance she is now' message. And I just discovered that Pussy2Mouth does not take your partner's oral virginity.
	
	Just restarted and tried the Brax encounter.  Attempted a Cowgirl but for some reason, I can't ride Brax's cock.
	
		
	Bree/Brandi pregnant talk
	
	
	If Brax beats you, when he takes off your clothes it replaces his name with yours
	
	I'm not sure if this was a bug or not but when testing the above bug, Brax as the dom wouldn't seem to start vagina sex until the exact moment you orgasm,
	 which is what made me notice the above bug in the first place. So I tried testing as many times as I could but Brax for some reason just wouldn't cooperate,
	  he'd do start anal sex before I'd orgasm but not vaginal, I just thought it was weird, might be a bug, might not, I dunno.
	
	Transformation fetish NPCs to be hybrids
		Gate Brax TF behind fetish
		NPCs force TF you on combat defeat
	
	Items!
	
	Quest mechanics are stupid x_x
	
	I tried recoloring bree's panties in black but just spent one brush. Can you either avoid dyeing on these kind of NPC's or make it persistent,
	
	
	Taking own (anal) virginity using tail gives Brax taking virginity scene
	
	
	after I move to the left and then return to Candi's desk I can't actually do anything to Brandi, and when I moved away from the desk, the game acted like I was still interacting with Candi, with Brandi's inventory screen instead of the map

		Add multiple colours to one body part (so you could have orange-black stripes or brown-white mottled fur and stuff ^^) spots, striped, mottled
			Single colour (default)
			Spots (Primary = background, Secondary = spots)
			Stripes (Primary = background, Secondary = spots)
			Mottled (Primary = background, Secondary = mottle)

	So I put on a jinxed clothing item, and now I'm stuck on the page telling me to talk to Lilaya
		Pressing continue (or 1) isn't doing anything
	
	
	[Ashley.they], [Ashley.them] and [Ashley.theirpro]
	
	No option to be bottom if you win as a male.
	 Also, I've seen a rather odd bug: at random I'll get a notice when an NPC has breasts or genitals exposed that I've never seen what that body part looks like, even though I'm now staring right at them.
	 So far the Succubus and a couple other general NPCs have had that at least once when they or I uncover their chest or any goodies downstairs.
	  I'll try a fresh new game later on as I realize I keep using my old saves and forget that that might cause issues as well.
	 One more thing, not really an issue but some might find it annoying: there doesn't seem to be a way to skip the intro anymore.
	
	
	I'm glad that the new enchanting system has addressed that other issue, but I might still add a 'Drink all' option for non-crafted potions/consumables. ^^
	
	
	I didn't see this in the notes but I noticed that the prices for Ralph's goods have gone up a bit, not a huge amount but things do cost a bit more.
	
	I know harpies are getting worked on, but just adding that I have encountered female harpies with the the deflowering fetish.
	 Also, harpies with a pregnancy fetish that ask me to breed them are still mad when I encounter them again and they are pregnant.
	
	
	I'll change those kissing descriptions soon (they don't really fit very well at the moment, you're right).
	
	Oh, also, Anonymous, I'll get that issue fixed as well. I'll make it so new vaginas have some starting wetness and elasticity, thanks for the feedback! ^^
	
	
	I'm not exactly sure what caused it, but after crafting potions I'm unable to exit the inventory screen
		The last thing I crafted was a human potion of larger testicles
		Also, the selfie screen seems to always say you have a genderless mound along with any genitals you have
		Can't seem to remove jynxed clothing, clicking the clothing in the dejynx menu doesn't do anything
	
	
	crotchless briefs

		Rewrite and improve a lot of those 'ongoing' descriptions during sex. (NPC's generateGenericPenetrationDescription method)
		
	
	Orgasms
	
	
	Tattoos
		
	Fix lag in clicking items in inventory
		
	I especially like the stripping reactions from PC/NPC as breasts and genitals are revealed, adds fun immersion. But I find that extra scene is missing if already naked or wearing crotchless panties.
	 Any chance of a reaction to those at start of battle/sex encounters? I'm sure some would give catcalls ;D Bonus for naughty exposed virgins.
	
	Add flavour text to explore action
	
	In Lilaya’s climax scene: that scene states that she pulls herself off the PC’s cock, but the game doesn’t reflect.

	  	Only the male human I fought and lost to had me doggy and just quite literally sat there and did nothing (his turns actually boiled down to him taking no action at all) until just before he came. 
			So far the option to be bottom for either male or female PC's is no where to be seen and even NPC's seem content to sticking to foreplay only.
	
	Go through and make sure resist is before normal->eager
	
	Maybe change it so that NPCs (while being the sub) will be allowed to penetrate you if your pace is gentle.
	
	add "feathered wings" to the [npc.arm+] command for harpy arms
		Rewrite harpy hands
		Leaving it as the arm ending in a hand covered in plumage and with feather-like fingers coming out if should work just fine.
		Parser "hand" and "finger"/"fingers" commands for harpy

		Face-to-wall:
			Reach around to breasts.
			Reach around to stroke cock.
			Descriptions of pushing into wall while fucking. (Reaching down to hold hips etc.)
		Pretty much every action x_x
			(They are all very generic and boring.)
		Orgasms in kneeling don't take pace into account properly.
		Orgasms in kneeling need a mutual variant.
		Expand/incorporate pace for all orgasms
		Herm fun in sixty-nine.
		Doggy actions:
			Grope breasts (reach around description).
			Add 'tail pull' as a rough action (grabbing base of tail and pulling back onto cock as fuck them). Remove this description from the generic 'Rough'.
			Add gentle fucking.

	go through documents. (The ones that person sent you ^^)
	
	If the player has a the "pure virgin" and "love" fetish, they'll gain the "innocent virgin" derived fetish.
		This fetish makes it so the player doesn't gain "broken virgin" if they lose they virginity with a monogamous lover.
		But if for some reason they ever have sex with a non-lover npc, either by rape or cheating, they gain "broken virgin" too.
	
	Also, now that we can mass-produce potions, it might be useful to mass-feed people them
		(Add a 'use all' option or something)
	
	I have a suggestion, not sure where to put it in the suggestion doc, features? However, anyways not sure if this has been suggested or not.
	 Whenever you submit/ lose to an npc they only have one orgasm then leave, have not encountered one that has more than one yet.
	  Could it be possible to increase the number of times they can orgasm before they are satisfied? Maybe you could use their stamina to determine how many orgasms they can have, maybe 1 per 20 stamina points,
	   can change this to balance it out a bit? Whenever I fuck an npc I make sure to fill all of their holes, maybe there could be a few who try to do the same or an npc with an impregnate
	    fetish will make sure to empty themselves to make sure the chance of impregnation is high or something along the same line of thought.
	
	
	Make all penetrative actions ignore self-penetration. (You can fuck partner even if they're fingering themselves.)

		TEST EVERY SEX SCENE
		Ralph: prioritise clothing removal before sex
		
		It seems that 69 sex is a position that can't be switched out of (and doggy?)
	
		because the option to request a pullout is X for me
	
		Better review the various buttons and the coloring post-refactoring.
	
	
	Content:
		After talking to Lilaya about any topic, one has to leave and re-enter the lab to talk to her again.
			Re-do all of Lilaya's scenes to allow continuation of talking.

		Scarlett quest progress
	
		----------
	
		
	Players with high enough strength/fitness and the dominant fetish should be able to flip the tables on Pix during her scene and dominate her
	
	Also, it'd be nice to be able to fuck Kate without her asking us to if we have high enough corruption
		Requirements: Cock, corruption>50
		Surprise penetration
	
	There's somewhat of an exploit with the bookcase in your bedroom. If you read the books you gain .5 intelligence from both books, but that's a one-time thing, I suppose.
		However if you save after getting the intelligence, close the game and reload your character you can read both again for a free 1 Intelligence each time you do this.

	Bimbo salon

		The top half being torn would reveal breasts, the bottom half would reveal groin, and the midriff would reveal stomach.

	Write variants for persistent NPCs encountering you after the first time.

	Main goals:
		Lilaya romance quest (becoming a demon) Going along with the theme of incest, Lilaya's mother looks exactly like your mother.
			After sex, she mentions wanting to show you how she can TF herself
			Next sex scene, she offers transformations
			After sex, she says how it would be so much better if she were a full demon
			Agree to help
			Have to contact Lilaya's mother (she likes burning bridges...)
			Go find her at demon home
			Have to persuade her to come visit Lilaya (Lilaya really burnt some bridges here...)
				Let her fem-dom you
				Passionate appeal
			She takes up residency at Lilaya's home (for the rest of the game).
			Next time you visit, you find her just having arrived. (She is mercilessly teasing Rose, who is extremely uncomfortable.)
				Lilaya breaks it up
				Lyssieth decides to stay for a while (she has a couple of slaves with her)
			Meet Lilaya in lab again
				She is annoyed that you didn't ask Lyssieth to TF her. (As you didn't really get an opportunity)
		
		
	
	{
		
		[60] Improved parter positioning actions. If your partner is the sub, they will request positions, requiring you to either go along with it, or deny them (which will stop them from attempting to position themselves again).
		[120] Improve orgasms and sex action types (cum inflation)
		
		[120] Character creation expansion
		[45] Move race status effect icon up to be the level-up icon. (Then do the same with your partner in sex.)
		[180] Phone menus
	}
	
	
	time progression changes
		shops closing
		(UI changes...)
	
	[60]

		tongue names
	
		add preferred positions and random fetishes to attackers
		partners need to be limited by corruption/fetishes as well
	
	I'll add a way to get your fingers wet, so that you can transfer saliva to your partner's (or your own) orifices easily.
	
	finger insemination
	
	orgasm reactions (cumming on player parts needs more detail, as well as directing away)
		Partner fucking player example:
		You feel partner about to orgasm. (along with their chosen attempt, either cumming inside or pulling out)
		Reaction option for partner in vagina: Allow pull out | Force creampie
		
		Partner giving blowjob example:
		Choose: Deepthroat | Cum in mouth | Facial
		Partner: Resist/submit | spit/swallow | stay still/direct away
	
	
	deny for sub?
	
	Painful stretching description variants.
		Descriptions should be things like "You cry out in pain as the wolf-boy's massive knotted cock forces its way into your tight asshole."
		
		
	
	Improve horny demon's penetration & dirty talk text.
	
	nipple fucking in 69 & kneeling
	
	Is to have penetration (and various other things) sort of be a "passive" state where the scene just assumes there's thrusting going on even if you actively choose other actions
	So the actions related to penetration would be more about changing pace, withdrawing, or special actions like mutual orgasm or denial or whatever
	Make pink text more narrative.
	
	Add 'free' perks
		Sexual preference (fem++, fem, bi, mas, mas++)
		Furry preference (moved from options)
		Racial preference (can select multiple)
	
	Make attackers during storm in rut/heat
		Rough/ignore all requests.
		
	Brax secretary TF warning
	
	
	I'm also going to greatly expand the character creation options at the start of the game. There will be more options for hair/eye/skin colours, as well as options for starting piercings/tattoos/clothing.
	 I'll also add more detailed body options, so you'll be able to customise all your starting body sizes/capacities/elasticities etc.
	
	Mutual orgasms (cum inside and pull out)
	Better orgasms (import from old scenes)
	
	
	Make action types (so can highlight them as important):
		PLAYER_POSITION_SWITCH(isPlayerAction, isOrgasm)
		PLAYER_PENETRATION
		PARTNER_POSITION_SWITCH
		PARTNER_PENETRATION
		
	
	finish:
		Improved mutual orgasms so that you always have the choice of how you want to orgasm.
	
	
	[120] Add cowgirl (dom+sub) 60/60
	
	----- Rolling into pregnancy:
	Lilaya (doesn't want to get pregnant)
		She asks you to pull out
			If you don't, she starts having a rant at you. "Aren't I supposed to be your aunt?! You want to get your aunt pregnant?!"
			"Yes": She grows a demonic cock and tries to impregnate you as some sort of twisted punishment
			"No": Advances to next stage.
		If you aren't infertile, you get her pregnant, and she gets really pissed off at you (no more sex, as she's really quite furious).
		Trigger for Lilaya quest progress. (She says she'll kick you out if you don't do as she says)
		Have to apologise by going to tell her mother that you got her pregnant (she won't let anyone else help her give birth)
		Maid at mother's house says she'll inform her mistress.
		Lilaya forgives you (unlocks pregnant Lilaya sex)
		
		
	Kate (wants cum, doesn't care if she gets pregnant)
		Sex scene while she's pregnant (same, but with flavour text)
		She's lactating
		Can cum on her belly
	
	
	
	
	
	Make weapons equippable in both slots (ranged weapons do less damage, but have an in-built crit chance?)
	
	
	Change fetishes to highlight in the status bar if they're applying effects.
		(e.g. anal fetish will provide +20% arousal if any anal pen is going on)
	
	
	
	change minx and the other one to:
		sexual preferences (can switch between at any time) (I can't use homosexual or heterosexual, as the nature of the game switches the PC's gender often, which would get confusing):
		
		Gynephilic:
			+more likely to encounter females
			-take increased tease damage from females
			+take decreased tease damage from males
		Androphilic:
			opposite
		Bisexual:
			encounter females and males at the same rate
			standard tease damage from both
	
	Need to make corruption more punishing. (Now that all sex actions are unlocked)
	
	
	
	Make pregnancy fetish unable to use condoms
	
	Combat:
		Factor in enemy sexual preference for tease attacks (they take 25% damage if they're not attracted to your gender)
		Add 'free perks', which you can switch between.
			'Furry'
			'sexual preference'
			'multi-breast'
		
	Add slap and tickle (Should fit in with Pix's character)
	
	Enemy refinement:
		In storm, everyone's in a rut/heat, so they don't care what gender you are.
		Otherwise, males will rape and oral females, and only oral males.
		Females will rape and oral anything.
		Corrupted enemies will use a single transformation on you before sex (into their race or opposite gender).
			(Can smash first drink to get the other one if you prefer.)
			Females: "I can get rid of the competition!"
			Males: "This city needs more girls for me to fuck"
		
	
	Tooltip over perks bugs when near edge of screen. (cause of those three bug reports)
	
	When you choose to submit after winning a fight, the dialogue gets mixed up at the second line (the enemy speaks as if they're you, and you speak as if you're the enemy.) It's especially funny if you have the bimbo fetish. :P
	
	Brax orgasms need some polish
	Need more mutual orgasms
	
	Remove fetish turning you on text. Instead, list +20% arousal as a bonus for the fetish perk. (too much writing clutter)
	
	Add penetrating sex effects for penis
	
	balance attribute modifiers
	
	add "safe from storm" effect, to make it clear there is a storm going on outside
	
	-----------------
	
	update inventory UI when clothing gets dirty
	
	Make requirements obvious in tooltip for options
		This may be a part of the DialogueNode revamp
	
	
	Fix tooltip heights.
	
	
	change non-consensual stuff.
		sexual preferences (set on character creation and can edit in options)
		will be respected by non-corrupted NPC sex scenes
		(your character says you're not into that stuff, and they leave)
		If enemy is high corruption, they'll rape you anyway (keep Dominion attackers low corruption to avoid this)
		Weak-aura Demon and demon futa will be first high corruption enemies that don't give a shit
	
	
	Status effects post-sex:
		"afterglow" (dom non-con or con)
		"violated" (sub non-con)
		
	Add corruption gains for choosing to rape someone/do corrupt things.
	Make options that do this appear purple (like sex is pink and combat is red)
	
	
	Do all sex scenes' fetishes and re-writes
	Remember:
		pure=kissing, vanilla=all standard, horny=anal, dirty=getting crazy, lustful=feeding cum/depraved stuff, corrupt=forced incest impregnation stype stuff
	
	add variations in oral scene for if you're creampied
	
	Give characters a lung capacity, and a gag reflex stat for measuring their deepthroating skill.
	
	Use 'Used Condoms' as the test object for individual item types.
	These will be used in the pregnant random attacker's scene.
	alleyway encounter: see a girl getting fucked, they leave the used condom behind (so you know what cum is inside). gain corruption?
	
	level up screen: perks in tabs, so can make icons bigger/easier to see
	| Strength | Intelligence | Fitness | Fetishes |
	
	tooltip appearing on right for a split second sometimes	
	
	Make Brax's scene repeatable (maybe not though, as he will be making a re-appearance later on in the story...)
	
	Corrupted demons
	Force demon tf on you (they sense your aura)
	Lilith's pet (demon TF item)
	
	Throat stretched stuff.
	Stretching should be 1-time, and only do it at penetration or for special events (taking a knot)
	Add stretchOrifice(character, PenisSize) to sex, so there can be extra stretch evens other than initial penetration. can then use this method in applyEffects() in SexAction
	
	In selfie/body descriptions, highlight racial parts and colours.
	
	Pregnancies:
		(Them) Kate
		(Them) Randoms (with pregnant encounter)
		(You) Ralph reactions/sex
		(You) Brax reactions/sex
		(You) Lilaya reactions/no sex while pregnant
		
	

	"I also have some crash logs in my public Lilith Dropbox: https://db.tt/Xd1x14UWSG"
	
	Floor needs special type of inventory (I haven't even tested if it can overflow!)
	
	Make buttons for all attacks (for those that don't want to use keyboard)
	
	test piercing loss on body part loss
	
	Make sure all listeners are working/needed
	
	Make overview map
	
	Succubi's Secrets
		Tattoos
	
	save screen
	
	highlight text back (disable it in all non basic screens though)
	
	Change "Do nothing" to "In control" to "Full control" at higher corruptions
		
	[Multi-Breasts Off | Extra Breasts all flat | Multi-Breasts On].
	
	Melee spells: basic damage and basic protection/shields. Ranged spells: offensive and defensive utility, which can take many forms
	add steal spell (steals a random piece of clothing). If steal panties or bra, the opponent misses their next turn "W-What are your doing?! Y-You pervert!"
		Add display rack for stolen panties
	
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	simple and detailed version of icons (for performance and better artwork)
	
	Corruption:
	NPC condom use & pull out (low corruption, they will, middle they won't, high they say they will, then don't)
	"Guilty concience" status effect if vanilla and didn't do as NPC asked.
	
	Pregnancy lore. The children inherit characteristics of the father, even though they're of the race of the mother. E.g. a harpy giving birth to a horse-morph's children will produce stronger than average harpies
	
	Shower at gym have same effects as at home. Maybe make a "wash" method
	
	TF hair colour
	
	
	
   For that matter, you should probably make there be a "window" for fertilization (if you haven't already done this - I'm too tired to check the code right now) where if you "might" get pregnant,
    the father can be anyone who inseminates you within, say, the first hour (or more) of the "risk of pregnancy" status.
      but it's good if there's at least a mechanic in place which allows for uncertainty of paternity if the player is getting around a lot.
	
	 Content is really bare bones as most town locations aren't done yet, you can beat the weak ass enemies at level 1 no problem, and the main quest hasn't even completed the first act.
	  tf potions work, but suffers from major case of furry. Most clothing just adds 1 phys def with the exception of the jinxed circlets found via rng.
	
	Think about changing how TF items work.
		Something cool, but not too grindy.
		Like needing three components to unlock a tf.
		Then easier once you have that?
		
	Your aura collects essences from defeated enemies
	Used in crafting
	Lore:
		Go see Lilaya after the first time you collect an essence.
		She is really surprised that you can do that, as only Lilin have that power.
		It doesn't hurt the people you take essences from, it's more like a snapshot of their power.
		She has all the equipment to use essences to create powerful potions (she explains this is where TF items come from)
		
		
		
		
	Core component: dog/wolf/cat etc.
	3 slots for Modifiers (can use any of the following in each slot):
		TF
		Sexual TF
		Stats
		Boost
	
New content
    Add beauty salon to Shopping Promenade (change hair colours & get piercings/tattoos).
    Add more variation to random assailants (human/partial/lesser/greater tf status, varying breast/penis/vagina sizes, varying skin/fur colours).
    Add in more content for Lilaya's romance storyline.
    Add in a rare chance for a demon encounter during storms.
    Add Pix's shower scene.
    Work on finishing the next stage of the main quest. This will involve writing content for two of the currently disabled map locations. It will also add in a new race, basic slave management, and a unique NPC (of the new race). (This is a long-term goal for v0.1.7).

Gameplay
    Fix how storage works at Lilaya's home.
    Stop random encounters from occurring at several places on the map. (To fit in with some lore that's coming in the new content.)
    Polish and improve Brax's scene. This will involve removing the bad end and adding in three unique item drops.
    Add in an option to reduce the amount of furry content. This will greatly reduce the chances of random encounters being greater/lesser morphs, but will not alter the body types of any unique NPCs.
    Expand character creation options.

UI
    Finish the light theme (I know some of the text colours are unreadable at the moment).
    Finish font resizing feature.
    Buttons are sometimes off-screen when the game starts.
    The save game window is sometimes not opening. I'll investigate this.
    Fix hotkey names on response options. (At the moment, it says things like 'Close Bracket' instead of ']')
    Fix all text colours.
    Make it more obvious when you gain/lose a status effect.
    Make it more obvious that you can undress in sex.

Clothing
    Improve the enchantment/jinxed mechanics. possibly introducing a "sealed" mechanic to jinxed items.

Combat
    !!!Balance combat!!!
    Add some combat-related items, and implement item usage (healing & utility consumables).
    Improve shield spells.
    Improve weapons (both variety and spells gained).

Transformations
    Create some unique icons for the non-racial TF items.
    Add more TF items.
    Add more TF possibilities.

Sex
    Polish and fix bugs in all sex scenes.
    Properly apply new corruption mechanics to all sex scenes.
    General improvements to all sex scene descriptions.

			If M/F, the male warms up with your mouth, then fucks/cums in your friend and forces you to clean up after him.

	dolphin mermaids with trap males 
	
	Aquarium in room
	
	
1. There should be a "take all" and "drop all" button for items in inventory. "Sell all" and "use all" wouldn't hurt either, to avoid repetitive button pushing.

Another note: you've incorporated a very unusual fetish item into your game - that "finger insemination" thing you mentioned in the change log. I don't know how big the percentage is, but I've heard people griping about the lack of content like that - autoinsemination of various sorts, etc. In my usual tradition of spewing out ideas, here are some additional mentions in that vein in case you are interested:
-Insemination from ejaculating over a gaping pussy (only possible with low tightness; or immediately after intercourse, if you add a "pull out" option, assuming a large enough cock vs inelastic enough pussy (assuming you go with my elasticity modification above))
-If you ever add threeways, giving a BJ and not swallowing or spitting followed by oral on a female could be used to push semen inside a vagina
-If you ever add condoms, self insem. with used condoms (for EXTRA perversity, add used condom stealing from sex scenes the PC witnesses, for that purpose)
-If you ever add group/gang bangs, could have some kind of "sperm racing" event where PC takes a bunch of sperm from participants and inseminates herself (funnel? turkey baster?) to see which one gets to be a father

	When non con is on the description of enemies attacking you acts as if all of them do not want to have sex witch you even if they do.
	
	: If you choose the resisting pace during a scene, begging the other person to stop requiers vanilla corruption,. Shouldn't begging someone to stop not require corruption at all?

		First time having sex, she forces you to pull out.
		After sex, she gets really awkward.
			Says she only had sex because of her demon instincts.
			She says she used every ounce of her willpower to resist you cumming inside of her, but it won't happen again, so DON'T CUM INSIDE OF ME!
			"This is why I avoid people! I-It's not like I want to go around fucking everyone I meet! A-Anyway, aren't I supposed to be your aunt?! W-What kind of pervert fucks their own aunt?!"
			"You started it!" "Sorry, I got carried away."
			From then on, she doesn't bother getting up when you find her fingering Rose.
		Have to apologise to her
			She tries to get away with a LOT. (Kiss her feet, massage feet, suck toes, full foot clean)
			You can say no at any time, so long as you said sorry she forgives you.
		Can 'trick' her into having sex again (this repeats until you get her pregnant).
		Cum inside her gets her pregnant (if corrupted enough, you can also use used condoms, as Lilaya can't resist being treated like a slut).
		She asks her mother to come help her give birth.
		Lyssieth enters, teases Rose, then asks you how you fucked her daughter.
			"So how did you impregnate my daughter hmm? Did you push her down on all fours, ripping her panties off, then fuck her like an animal? Filling her womb with your cum, growling down in her ear that she's going to carry your children?"
		Lilaya saves you and has an argument with her mother. (Lilaya is angry, Lyssieth apologising and treating Lilaya like a fragile child)
			"If you want to ask about how one of your daughters fucks, why don't you go ask one my countless sisters?!"
			"Please Lilaya, I have no interest in talking with those sluts. You know you're my only real daughter."
		Go see Lilaya after she gives birth (to imps), only to find that Lyssieth has locked her in chastity.
		Have to prove to Lyssieth that you can take good care of Lilaya (have to bring her to orgasm 5 times as she watches).
		Lyssieth concedes that Lilaya knows what she's doing, and tells her the Lilin's ultimate secret; how to turn people into demons.
		You can then get Lilaya to go full demon at any time.
		She can also turn you into a demon (non-reversible!!!)
	
	
	
	
	
	Add fucking stalls to slaver alley
		Make money by working there (get more for more holes: 25 base blowjob, +10 for vagina, +20 for anal, +10 for each fuckable nipple)
		Spend money to fuck a hole (costs 30 for blowjob, +15 for vagina, +25 for anal, +15 for each nipple)
			Charged after having sex, if you don't have enough, you're banned until you can pay off the debt
			
	Add pregnancy roulette to slaver alley
		Either pay to enter:
			You and 5 other guys cum in a slave (who's taken a Vixen's virility).
			Afterwards, you wait 30 mins for them to test who got her pregnant.
			If you got her pregnant, you have to pay the penalty of 800 flames.
			If you didn't, you win 100 flames.
		Or get paid to be the girl:
			6 guys fuck you after you've taken a Vixen's virility.
			You get tested to see who knocked you up.
			You get paid 200 flames.
	
	Felicity is a trap.
		she invites you in and tries to get you drunk
		flirts with you
		drunk sex (she gets really dominant when she's drunk. REALLY dominant...)
		
	Pix
		You enter the shower, no sign of Pix.
		As you're showing, you didn't hear her sneaking up behind you.
		She presses into your back and starts instructing you how to wash yourself.
		Reaches around and masturbates you (reward for having a proper clean), fingers ass (if penis, milks prostate), washes & feels breasts, kisses neck (tastes if all sweat washed off yet).
		Rubs soap over back and grinds her 6 breasts up and down your back.
		She doesn't let you turn around.
		Once you orgasm she calls you a good boy/girl and bounces away
		
	Scarlett (male lesser harpy)
		Harpy males have feminine names to seem even more submissive to females
		Ask for Arthur, he doesn't know his slave's names
		You say he's a human and Scarlett recognises him
		Tells you he'll tell you where Arthur is if you'll fill in on one of his fucking stalls. (he sold too many slaves, and now has a shortage of orifices for clients to fuck)
		Can repeat this for cash later on.
		He comes in and tells you to stop moaning so loud (he's trying to work).
		If you moan loudly again he comes in and puts a ring gag on you then fucks your face.
		Can SPH him.
		If refuse, you have to give him enough money to buy a new slave (800)
	-----------------
	
	Final boss for first act:
		Trap-loving high-class demon.

		Using Arthur (he's actually quite famous among arcane-users, Scarlett and Brax didn't realise quite who he was)
		She sent Brax after Arthur as she intended to buy him all along
		Arthur is being forced to create trap-creating arcane bracelets (he keeps telling her that won't work (only consumables can be manipulated into transforming people) but she won't listen)
		On defeat:
			She turns you into a trap (doesn't care about race).
			Have to watch as her house guests fuck other traps and cum in them.
			Gives you a choice:
				Have to lick out their cum.
				She lets you go if you beg her to allow the house guests to fuck your ass.
				This keeps going on until you ask to be fucked.
	
	
	UI criticism/commentary:
Buying and selling is painful; if you could add an intermediate "shop table" area where multiple items could be placed, that would alleviate a lot of the pain.
The minimap is a bit hard to use; from a glance, you cannot easily tell where you are; add an icon or something to highlight the tile you're in.
Gameplay:
Where are my demons at?
Consider having the penalties be less (or more!) harsh depending on whether submitting is voluntary or not; IMVHO, there's a big difference between voluntarily saying "All right, I give in" and fighting to the last.
Will there be a toyshop, so you can voluntarily stretch out your throat or whatever without having to find a horsie, and then submit?
Will there be more advanced "testing"?

	The map isn't appearing for some of you. I'd advise getting the most up-to-date version of Java, as this might fix that problem. I'm using JavaFX for the GUI, and I noticed on my other computer that some of the UI elements weren't rendering when I was using an older version of Java. I'll also investigate this problem further in case it isn't related to the Java version (as it's a pretty major bug not being able to see the map!).
	
	If you get a 'Java Exception', it could be several things. I'm going to add a crash report feature to the engine soon which will show exactly what's gone wrong (I'm thinking of having it create a crash report text file which you could then copy-paste here).
	
	The save game window isn't opening. Again, I'll investigate this!
	
	Thread spawning & high memory usage
	Feedback on UI (everything should be accessable with mouse, I struggled to create a keyboard-friendly inventory management system)
	Minimap - UI scaling is a bit wonky at the moment, I plan to improve the UI a lot more
	Random game crashes - I'll implement the crash report feature soon!


	CONSIDER: Corruption mechanics need to unlock stuff.

		She points out that you haven't drunk or eaten anything since arriving (bar TF consumables).
		You don't need to eat or drink in this world, as the arcane gives energy to people.
	Waterworks:

	- Level 2 freezing opaque deamonstone seems to cast slam instead of ice shard. The chill effect is still triggered though.
- The option menu does not work from the inventory : you are forced to go on another menu before.
- Wearing too masculine clothing when you have a feminine body does not seem to trigger any stat reduction like it would do with a male wearing too feminine clothing (intended ?). However, it does trigger and remain once you had non-consensual sex (lose a fight).

That's all I could find for now.

I would also suggest the following addition :

- Fire element seems to be obviously stronger than other elements so far due to its additional damage effect. I think the additional effect from poison and ice should also be buffed in order to make all elements a bit more balanced.
- Poison Shield and Ice Shield are not only useless at the moment due to the lack of poison and ice damage : they also look underwhelming. I suggest to make the poison shield deal poison damage to melee attackers and ice shield to reduce stamina/willpower of melee attackers.
- Stamina does not seem to have any purpose in combat right now : it's just used at the gym. I suggest to make spells drain stamina instead of willpower. It would give more sense to the chill effect as well, preventing the enemy from using their skills too much.
	
	
	Add in race & item discovery quests (bottom of character creation dialogue class).
	
	- Fix descriptions in inventory 
	
	- Refine selfie.
	
	- Fix all RacialBody parts to use parts specific to their race
	
	- Make harpy wing description have hands (everyone needs hands for descriptions)

	-TODO Items:
	
		- Add corruption gains!
		
		- Multiple: Transformative items for race
			- Milked from demon's factories in the desert district (this is not common knowledge)
			- Demons have corrupted futa milking cows for each race, and combine their own cum with with their sexual fluids, using magic to make them transformative.
			- All transformative crystals should follow the theme of "crystal-strength-name animal-hint" e.g. "lesser crystal of the lupine howl"
		
		- Potions that temporarily increase attributes, following naming theme "potion-strength-name of attribute-theme" e.g. "elixir of strength" or "draught of iron-skin"
		- Food, magic-shots & drink. Generic and racial-specific. Generic provides minor + for each resource. Racial provides +++ for each resource based on transformation stage.
			(Magic shots are small crystals that you break open. The magic regenerates your mind. Sort of like drugs, but no addictive properties.)
	
	- redo crop tops
	
	- Incorporate help into options
	
	- Inventory needs polish (remove items from populated areas, text descriptions a little bit off here and there)
	
	-TODO All encounters in Dominion sketched out.
		
		- Streets neutral:
			- Storm random attack

	Make a special description when you become a complete race.
	
	Slimes should get clothes dirty instantly.
	
	Races page in journal should show race's average stats & body (like combat revamp will be)
	
	Like health and mana, make all attributes floats.
	
	Make NPCs
	
	5)  Finish sex class
		Refine arousal gains from all actions.
		Go through all TODO in Sex class and fix them.
		
		KEEP THE DESCRIPTIONS DOWN TO 1 OR 2 SENTENCES FOR COMMON ACTIONS.
		Long descriptions soon become a chore to read and take up a lot of screen space. Keep them short and sweet.
		For penetration you can make descriptions longer.
		
		In sex actions, if player/partner is ready to penetrate, change "do nothing" to "prevent penetration"
		
		TODO Lose health if being stretched. Loses more health the bigger the cock. Reduces health loss if lubed.
		If you get to 0 health, you can use composure to hold on, if you don't, or are at 0 composure, you pass out and gain a lot of corruption
		(if you are dom, they pass out into misionary and you can fuck their passed out body)
		You wake up later and applies stretch mechanics as though you were fully stretched to his size
		
		Need specific descriptions of continuing penetration (e.g. doggy says how tits are swaying with each thrust)
		
		Finish SexManager
		
		Masturbation, Foreplay, Missionary, Doggy & against wall for repeatable NPCs at release
		Specific ones for Vicky and story lines
		
		Pull out options
		
		COMBINE MASTURBATION INTO SEX
		
		//TODO drop player clothes on floor after sex if was sub.
		// If player resists when partner is taking their clothes off, partner rips them off
		
		Make playerSexualCry() occur when arousal is over 50
		Make PlayerSexTalk into a class that is created for AbstractCharacters, so can for npc and player. Things to say when being penetrated/penetrating/neither:
		Sub and resisting
		Sub and accepting
		Dom and you are resisting
		Dom and you are submitting
		Player can define custom lines in character screen.
		
		Masturbation placeholder for all types
		Add racial-flavour text & unique bodyPart descriptors (imagine being partnered with one of your race)
		
		Also do this for transformations.
		Polish all transformation descriptions.
		Don't lose stats from transformation stats
		
		
		--------------------------------------
		
		Before you do the next part, go through races and make sure 100% that is what you want them to be like.
		
		Add imps (don't worry about Lilin and Alpha Imp yet)
		
		Harpy male descriptions (they look like females but with more colourful feathers, male harpies get treated like dirt and are constantly humiliated because they aren't as attractive as the females)
		Change Tengu to be more aggressive versions of harpies (harpy flock is owned by a femlae tengu who will have a male tengu as her personal bitch)
		Harpy matriarchal society
		
		THEN:
		
		Go through all body part setters and put in generic descriptions for NPCs. Then can use these as a base for player transformation descriptions.
		
		
		
		
		In scenes, give a button to "examine scene" which gives a brief sentence about what's going on and describes all important characters
	  
	  ------------------------------------------
	  
	6)
		SetContent, when text is longer than the displayed page, causes flickering if not at bottom of page when going back/pressing 0. It puts page to bottom, then goes back.
		But not when going back???
		Javascript seems to be putting scrollbar to bottom, THEN going to next dialogueNode
		
		Alcohol items.
		Give player an alcohol int that degrades over time. Give status effects when get tipsy, drunk, hammered which reduce maximum composure.
		Give bonus physical strength. Reduce dodge and hit chance.
		Make a speech parser for drunk speech
		
		Make level-up perks
		The more corrupted you get, the harder it is to resist demon's commands (resisting costs willpower). At 100, you will do anything they command you to. At higher levels, it takes more willpower to resist demands.
