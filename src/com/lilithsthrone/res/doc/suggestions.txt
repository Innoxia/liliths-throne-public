	
	I'll probably add some more detailed descriptions of how much pre-cum is being produced based on how much cum you're producing. If I do create a dedicated pre-cum stat, it will most likely be based off your cum volume.
	
	when someone is lactating and has fuckable nipples, their nipples are counted as 'dry' for the purposes of penetration, even though they're leaking milk
		milk lubrication, and descriptions
	
	isPenisPrehensile()
	
	get Nyan to try on a bunch of clothes until we find one we want to fuck her in
	
	romance:
		apologise after victory
	
	giggle action in sex
	
	add cum inflation and overflow stuff to the orgasm scenes soon
	
	condom enchanting -> flavour, ribbing, chance to break, etc.
	
	Achievements
	
	nipple/dick self-suck
	
	Quite a few male vaginal penetrations are corruption linked only to having vanilla corruption. Should not the impregnation fetish also unlock these
	
	rub titties on other titties
	
	tongue longer, prehensile
	
	Would it be possible to start as a futa/herma ... even if it costs a debuff or the loss of picking one of the bonus at the start. I know it is pretty easy to become one but it would be cool if one of the options made it so the group in the intro made you drink a futa potion along with threatening to "have some fun". 
	
	gentle fetish
	
	lusty maiden cap corruption at 80
	
	spell: heart storm
	
	FeliciTea's

	Backpacks and pouches that when wearing will upgrade your inventory space
	
	Maxi skirts
	
	handholding fetish
	
	permanent displace toggle (so don't redress after sex)
	
	Urethra and Clit slots could work well, along with possibly external balls
	
	 dunno if this has maybe been suggested before but it could be fun if there was maybe like, an option or something to scale enemy levels up when you level up?
		like maybe not necessary for the full game but i kinda like not feeling super powerful so quickly if that makes any sense. 
		I was considering something like that, I'll add it to my list and see if I cna get that implemented when I do the combat rework
		Although it would probably be something simple like making all NPCs no lower than 3 levels beneath you
	
	also, if an NPC wants to fuck my pussy, but my pussy is at max wetness, can they stop trying to finger me first xD its not a huge deal, its just always like.. okay. they are wetting their fingers.. this is taking a while, when do i get preggo already, lo
	
	a special action to oral/kiss a hole that has been creampied
	
	combinations of colours are completely random at the moment, change this.
	
	Combat/tease descriptions change as more damage is dealt.
	
	slavery:
		 get essence farming going on.
		 Rape Brothel: chase down your own prey, anything you catch you get to fuck
	
	
	
	Encyclopedia for mechanics:
		plasticity
		barbs
		orifices
		etc.
	
	
	piercings referenced in sex
	
	
	Work for Lilaya as a maid
	
	look into adding a way to mark offspring as 'uninterested in encountering' from the pregnancy stats screen.
	
	Summons:
	
	 the summons should be created before combat starts.  The player should be able to walk around with their pets/summons, and customizing them in some way would be nice for player advancement and team management.
	
	Mostly I was thinking about when the player gets the option to summon and what sorts of summons you get.
	 For example, it might make sense the player explores Dominion for a little while, with minimal enemy parties.  Then they're getting ready to go somewhere more dangerous, say the harpy nests, and they're forced to go back to Liliya for a moment.
	She teaches them how to summon one type of companion and you gain the power to maintain one at a time with limited customization options.
	As you progress in the game, expanding the areas and difficulty you can tackle, quests that reward you with new summon types or a larger number of companion slots become available.
	Also, more customization options and more equipment slots to buff your summons.(edited)
	
	The ideas I had for summons so far are: elementals (most basic), clockwork pets, mini-race fairies (cat fae, dog fae, bovine fae), demon animals (hellhounds, bloodhawk, chimera), etc.
	  The player unlocks these in different ways and your opponents will call on ones that are suitable for their personality, culture, and environment.
	    For example, mini-races require romancing an NPC that started as that race, demon animals come from demons.
	      In turn, generic NPCs of a specific race are more likely to call on their mini-race as a summon while demons are more likely to rely on demon animals.
	
	How about an option to cum on your partners tits (assuming they haev any.) Or instead of deep throating, pull out until only the tip is in, forcing them to taste your cum. Spitting/swallowing/cum-shooting-out-the-nose dependant on partners fetish or yourown production rate
	
	Clothing sets:
		Princess
		Slave
		Latex
	
	
	Personalities:
-Each personality includes a library of dialogue lines for different situations.
-These are used by both NPCs and the PC, one is chosen during character creation.
-The primary thing that these personalities affect are the lines spoken during the 'dirty talk' action and when random lines are spoken in sex scenes.
-Some buttons are also changed to reflect the PC's attitude ("Have some fun" vs "Help them out" vs "Take advantage of their lusts")
-Fetishes may weigh what personality is chosen for an NPC, so sadists are more likely to be selfish or rude.
	
	
	when you add the tea house, the person behind the counter should say goodbye with 'Tea you later', while their colleague shoots them an incredibly dirty glance
	
	animal sheaths (foreskin? hmmmm)
	
	add a "maximum internal capacity" mechanic
		This would allow things like stomach bulge, inflation and cum going all the way through based on quantity, number of orgasms and penetration size.
	
	NPC pace changes based on pain from small orifice, being forced to orgasm multiple times while resisting, things like that
	
	glowing parts having them glow brighter when aroused
		limit the NPC spawning options, but I'd like to give the player as much freedom to choose as possible
	
	deer-morph colour should be: #ec9538
	
	attacker broodmother scene includes how huge their belly has gotten.
	
	Silly suggestion. Plenty of sex while pregnant = children with more kinks by default. (RE)
	
	chastity probably make them able to have any enchantment. I guess the willpower resistance makes sense though, maybe they could have that as an extra enchantment by default
	
	We clearly need a demon with an incest-focus at some point... Maybe even a selfcest option... Beat her, and she offers to turn into your twin for the duration of your sex-scene
	
	give you an option of taking control of one of the two during slave-on-slave events
	
	striped socks/underwear
	
	can we get tails and wings to be colored seperately like penises are?
	
	toed socks, full gloves, pants and thight tops
	
	virli-tea, fertili-tea and virgini-tea
	
	Hesitant pace
	
	Gacha machine for tiny Lilith's thone action figures to put in your room
	
	Heterochromia
	
	a potion or something that you use to cum your own cumslimes.
	
	Kind of surprised tabards/loin cloths haven't been suggested yet, actually. Well, guess they have now. I figure the tabard could be for feminine and the loin cloth can be the masculine opposite
	
	Like exposed gives you -willpower, but being an exhibitionist gives you a free spirit buff that gives +energy and +seduction damage if you have exposed.
	
	twin enemies
	
	infertile perk
	
	Shop that can replicate quest reward items
	
	I'd like the ability to cum in someone's pussy, ask them their name and just say "I'll just call you "Mom"" if virility is high enough
	
	storm:
		run to the nearest home and ask them to let you wait out the storm, possibly being forced to return the favor
	
	"rub my cock on her big preggo belly, then spray my cum all over it" 
	
	What about an advanced fetish "spoiled revenge" by having broken virgin and deflowering fetishes. You gain bonus exp deflowering masculine NPCs in vengeance for your lost innocence
	
	Customisable: cum, milk, girl cum, cocks, nipples, anus, and vagina (flavours (random))
	
	contacts and pupil shapes given by Kate
	
	Maybe there could be a side quest where you could unlock a spell for LIlaya where she can boost development and deliver in one event
	
	Strip tease -> removes a piece of clothing but deals high tease damage
	
	add a small chance of pregnancy if a cum-covered finger/cock/tail penetrates you
	
	More size variation for penis/breasts etc.
	
	I will change the piercings to 'neutral femininity', good call.
	
	 I'll also add 'jockstrap' to the list of clothing to add in the future!
	
	 A "buy all" button when buying from shop
	 	For the selected article, not clearing out the shop
	 	
	 impregnation fetish allow vaginal sex without corruption
	
	Different body aprts giving stats.
	
	Pubic/Chest/Armpits hair
	
	Any chance of orifice-stretching and orifice-recovery being able to be tracked separately... I like repeated stretching, so high flexibility is fun, what with the recovery and all that, but it's less fun that stretching takes only a single turn
	
	Rose tie her up and tickle her with that damn feather duster
	
	And I guess... I dunno. You COULD categorize clothing options into 'chaste' and 'slutty'. And make corrupt people/bimbos more likely to pick slutty choices.
		(Better to add a sluttiness value)
		Higher corruption characters could also be more likely to skip articles of clothing entirely as well.  Like not bothering with underwear or going topless.
	
	Suggestion (if possible?) on interface- the little popups when your mouse is hovering over a button action- can we get a disable for that in settings, or maybe more time delay?
	 I for one have most of them memorized and it gets distracting having those cover over the action text.
	
	Combat: steal/rip off clothes
		: add a grappling subsystem so we can grab them in a bearhug and then grind
		if you have them grappled when the fight ends, it transitions directly into dominant sex
		grapple them to get them hot and bothered for submissive sex
	
	larger inventory in bedroom. Since we can store stuff there seems reasonable that itd be a lot more than personal inventory.
	
	Speaking of which would it be possible/logical/worth implementing 2 fetishes. Alpha female and alpha male, it would give you a tease option that is particularly effective against members of the opposite gender
	 (And maybe a stat boost or something).
	 However, the downside would be that you cannot flee combat from members of the same sex as you (After all you will tolerate no rivals and you can't be called an alpha any more if you run from a challenger),
	 if you used the tease on a member of the same sex it would be more of taunt that has a chance to stun the target (intimidation) saying things along the lines that all guys/ladies are yours to breed with.
	
	give each each tile a tooltip that shows who's in the tile, as well as what items are on the floor there
	
	Produce milk -> make nipples wet!!!
	
	Tongue length, width, type
	
	While you're working on "Kneeling dom" you could probably also add in paizuri at the same time, I don't think it wouldn't be that hard?
		Something like a start line, a stop line, and a handful of action lines?  How many lines are there in something like fingering?
	
	Giantess fetish
		make something like that where your minimum and maximum heights are raised, or something like that ^^
		
	Hair pulling during sex!
	
	Ralph to knock up NPCs PC has in house. (Take them to Ralph in exchange for discount.)
		
	try to tidy up Nyan's (and the other shop keepers) menus ^^
		
	One thing i want to do is disable all the regular male random encounters but keep hermaphrodite to low but i cant currently do that. Is there a way you could set it so fully male encounter rate can be set to zero?
		
	Map: showing their name on hover is a good idea
		
	tail, wings, and horn clothing
		
	Could we get an option to discard items in combat? It's sorta annoying running out of inventory space while trying to steal clothes...
		
	add an option somewhere: "Embarrassed about wearing opposite-gender's clothing" 
		
	Add Lilith's tower basement to submission
	
	 Lactation/breast growth/hip and ass growth induced by pregnancy
	 
	Differently sized pregnant stomachs based on how many kids the mother is carrying?
	
	Change: "the big red text saying slave permits are "currently unavailable" was supposed to imply that the quest ended there for now"
	
	Add option for sexuality encounter rate.
	
	Marker pens/body writing
	Collars/leashes
	
	Being able to save selfies and compare them to what you are now
	
	Cum lubrication transfer cause pregnancy?
	
	pasties get some sort of partial exposure tag
	
	add a distinct color to the page arrow buttons to make it clearer there is a next page of choices, or just make it clearer to the player that there is more.
	
	UI sex action alignment could be tweaked.
	
	milk fetish
	
	add way to skip sex scenes
	
	make the traps have more trap-like features, and also add cum inflation later on
	
	Ability for PC/NPCs to ask partner to be more gentle/rough?
		I might make a sub-menu during sex of all possible requests/talking actions, and put more things like that in there
		maybe make NPCs resist if you ignore their request to be gentler
		
	maybe make masochist characters gain more pleasure from being raped
	
	Traps:Perhaps if they have large breasts, they'll have large cocks, and vice versa...
	
	fetish specific dirty talk
	
	Dirty talk could also be influenced by the last action you did
	
	'non-pen/foreplay' perks/fetishes (fingers, tongue, etc.)
	
	On another note, the sub taking control would make for a kicker feature.
		(Perhaps if sub has dom fetish, and dom has sub fetish, there could be a 'turn tables' action)
	
	Split fetishes up.
	
	Only crotchless chaps
	
	make it possible to have cloaca-like slit allowing you to retract your cock and hiding your balls in your body while having a dick other than the human-like bird dick
	
	I'd say that an "Are you sure?" should be a thing on the New Game button.
		I just accidentally 30 minutes.
	
	compare tootip to compare worn vs store/found items
	
	Maybe I could add someone who buys used condoms for... reasons... for a price depending on what cum is in there (with demon cum being the highest value)
	
	 please make it so i can wear a ring on a elbow lentgh glove their thin enough for that
	
	 A chastity fetish, which would involve the player being on the recieving end of a "deny" action
	
	cum that applies feminizing TFs to partners that  come in contact with it
	
	the potions that increase lactation have a much smaller effect than any of the other fluid increasing potions
		increase lactation and cum increases from potions
		I'll look into increasing the cum production increase from potions.
		I will definitely make a stronger cum production increase potion soon.
		
	How about having love fetish buffs only come into effect if the PC in a monogamous relationship (and hence, in love with someone)?
		Effects could be: 50% resistance to all seduction/willpower attacks if PC is in a relationship. 5% willpower increase. -25% effectivness to all PC seduction attacks (as they feel guilty)
	
	Add large increase/decrease for hip size.
	
	add an option to toggle off male/female animal junk individually , I can tolerate and sometimes appreciate the occasional full furry but dog benis/vagina is too far.
	
	
	 a faster pumping option than "normal fuck" that isnt "rough fuck"
	 add another action called "fast fuck" that doesn't set a pace, but uses the current pace in its descriptions
	
	Choosing how fetishes are assigned.  Based on their race, their traits, what traits they'd likely want in partners based on their sexuality.
	Fetish suggestions:
	-After choosing sexuality, assign fetishes semi-randomly.  There are three things to be assigned.
	-First, determine if character likes their current body (high chance ~80%) or may have opposing preferences.  If they like their body, assign personal fetishes relating to their current appearance.  If not, assign personal fetishes at random.
	-Second, determine if the character prefers sex with their own race (high, ~60%), another race (low, ~20%), or is ambivalent about race (low, ~20%).
	  Assign a race preference fetish based on the result, either their own race, a random race, or no race fetish at all.
	    Then randomly roll to add commonly fetishized races or common kinks for their own race, like demons, if they're not ambivalent.
	-Finally, determine if the character prefers traditional traits for their chosen sex and race (high, ~50%), partially traditional (moderate, ~30%), or non-traditional ones (low, ~20%). 
	 Add all partner and sex act kinks from the list of common traits for sex/race if traditional, mostly common with a random one if partially traditional, and mostly random if non-traditional.
	 
	For example, a male wolf-morph with an average cock and knot that is heterosexual (traits and fetishes are used as an example and are not necessarily things that are or will ever be in game).
	 
	 
	 
	Oh. We need an equivilent of the health perk tree for willpower
	 
	We lack an ability to sell (n) items at stores
		you can only sell all or just one at a time
	 
	If he rolls traditional, he might like having a knotted cock and a muscled body.  He might prefer sex with other wolves.  He might like partners with multiple breast rows, big tails, and knotting them vaginally in sex.
	 
	If he rolls non-traditional, he might want to grow out long hair and get tattoos.  He might prefer sex with humans and demons.  He might like partners with piercings, smooth skin, and penetrate him anally.
	
	RMB as bindable
	 enabling num-pad in addition to regular numbers to work?
	
	make it so that NPCs with impregnation/seeder fetishes force-feed you Vixen's Virility pills then try and breed you or something ^^
		also for girls who eat vixen's virility pills and try to ride you
		
	Oh!! And kiss and bit necks and boobs...and oral people that you beat -  without 69!
		Sucking and milking
		a less than 1inch penis can break a hymen...but a hand can't?
		
	Cum, milk, saliva causing TFs
	
	Are you planning on having crossdress fetish npcs force you into clothes of their choice if they dominate you?
	
	Being egged on by the npcs based on their fetishes and varying dirty talk if the act is satisfying their fetish.
	
	change the colour of the action button or something to signify that it's an action that enters a new area
	
	Addictive cum, maybe things like flavour, viscosity, colour
	
	use sextoys under clothes to prevent decreasing openess or to do some other things
	
	a perk where you can decide what you can get pregnant from
	
		Suggestion: counterpart to denial fetish, a blueball fetish
		Or an edging fetish if that's too much
			maybe it could be implemented with the slavery features, where you forbid your slave NPCs from cumming until you say otherwise
			and maybe some hypnose item/skill that makes it so they can't cum no matter how much stimulation they go through
		I meant as in, you get pleasure from edging and getting blueballed
		Maybe the Frustration status could get replaced for people with that fetish
	
	The use of the force spell would be nice for generating props durring sex. IE make a chair of force so you can have the same sorta seated sex you can have with Lilaya. Hell it would be lovely if you could even make a matress of force magic so you could have missionary.
	
	Alexa quest variation for if taken over nests.

	1)  Four main types of clothes for each slot: Plain (no bonuses), Armored (defensive bonuses), Sexy (offensive bonuses) and Bondage (heavy offensive and defensive penalties, bonus to xp).
	2) (edit: this is already accepted, but here's my two cents anyway) Anal and vaginal slots. Probably in the right side alongside the piercings and etc. Anal would be mostly buttplugs and vaginal mostly dildos.
	 There could be a plain buttplug/dildo with no bonuses, a metal one which somehow protects the hp or is "holy" and protects the willpower,
	  a spiky/oversized one which provides bonus willpower attack and a bondage one which provides a debuff (and maybe xp bonus).

	Capsule pregnancy?
		it would probably take the form of fucking someone you defeated and forfeiting any essence gains in exchange for getting knocked up/knocking them up with a maybe-random potion or something
		would probably be faster than a regular pregnancy, but also disable essence gains for longer
		strength/quality of the resultant potion would probably be based on the strength of the enemy you faced
	
	I want passersby to grope me in LT. Not like to start a fight, just a thing that happens when walking around. Like if you're hot enough or exposed enough people will start getting touchy feely.
While that should probably be gated, and fall under non-con, I don't want to be raped, just lightly assaulted.
	
	Voyeur scene (Lilaya + Rose in lab)
	
	teleport. As a legit suggestion could we get some sort of "Mark and Recall" effect?
	
	Roleplaying Fetish, an option to switch out the dialogue your character will say during sex based on the outfit they're currently wearing.
	 For example, if you had this fetish and were wearing the full Enforcer Uniform and were receiving the set bonus, then you could pretend to be
	  arresting the NPC for dom content or were overwhelmed by a criminal for sub content instead and get specific dialogue to that effect.
	
	Dolly: Requires both anal and cum fetishes. Bonus defense when not having any pussy or penis.

	refusal to have sex without condoms on some NPCs and if it's detected possibly the sex pace goes to resisting

	Celibate: requires both pure virgin and hand fetish. No longer affected by the penalty of not cumming during sex scenes
	
	Masculine footwear how about Steel Toed boots
	
	add a fem and masc option to set the rates for all races
	
	cameras, so you can take pictures and/or videos of sex and publish them for all of Dominion to see, as an addition to exhibitionism
		I just thought it'd be nice to be able to make porn so you can expand the scope of exhibitionism beyond your immediate vicinity. Maybe become a sexual celebrity or something
		Maybe there could be like a shop in the mall that does lewd photoshoots and publishes them in a magazine
	
	(silly ^^) Work fetish:
		It could grant +50 willpower but at the cost of sometimes your PC refusing to rest when you try to make them.
		
	add some kind of 'pregnancy test' item that tells you all the details about your current pregnancy.
		
	fill the library with more books ( lootable ) - for example book about the species, telling their positive and negative sides, preferred sex positions, special attacks and so on
		
	good geneder neutral item for the stomach slot could be a Sarashi (Bandages worn around the waist)
	
	It'd be nice to see some further tweaks to the clothing feminine/masculine debuff. The debuff should probably be -1 or -2 per item of clothing instead of straight -5.
	
	add tongue transformation (e.g. to a rough cat tongue or a prehensile demon tongue etc.), throat size/wetness/etc. and voice pitch to the list of TFs
	
	Tooltips/popups on the stats screen so you know where a stat is coming from
		EG: hover over a number in the stats screen for a list of where that number is coming from
	
	perhaps a buy all button in conjunction with the sell all button
	
	expand/rework furry option menu to give more control over what body parts you want to see on each race
	
	new position idea: lifted pussy lick, where the PC or NPC, whoever is dom, would lift the partner and eat them out while in the air
	
	biting & snowballing
	
	Improve potion effects
	
	UI improvements:
		what about keeping the selected item stay active if there are multiples?
		I recommend looking over the furry preferences window as the spacing seems off
		specifically Horse-morph
		also the, what seems to be, gray rectangle under each text is unisized. This is fine but I'd say shorten the names
		also some of the text gets overlapped by the next set of text
		a suggestion for crafting: It seems, at least for me, it's more intuitive if one is to press the potion picture to select crafting rather than having a crafting button on the bottom.
		
	add areola sizes as well as nipple length to the game soon!
	
	once power bottom is added you can allow NPCs without penises to choose face to wall so they can lick your ass.
	
	Cumming inside with a knotted dick should disable pulling out for a while
		add a 'knotting' action, which will totally prevent pull-out, and change thrusting actions into in-place humping
		a few rounds after orgasm
		And add an extra scene of waiting it out if you choose to end sex before it deflate
		70% arousal, 'Knot them' action appears -> 'knot them' locks you into that orifice, and replaces penetrative actions with humping versions -> orgasm -> stay knotted for 4 or so more rounds
		I guess knots could increase pregnancy chance, yeahs
	
	
	horseshoes
	sandals
	
	i just need an option to beg for anal until they give it to me
		instead of the request option disappearing
	
	How about two garter belt items then? One that uses the leg slot and is meant to be paired with thigh high boots. And one that's already paired with stockings to go in the sock slot?
		A Lace garter belt (sock slot) and a latex garter belt (leg slot)
	
	Improve human perks
	
	Bondage fetish - unlocks cursed items
	
	Spawn in enemies with opposing fetishes
	
	piercing studs
	
	Reactions to revealing lingerie is a good idea, I'll add that to my todo list, along with reactions for if you're already exposed
	
	make an individual toggle for each of the "furry" parts you want to see later on
	
	You should add the ability to lengthen/shorten horns, tails, and wings
	
	I want more autumn/winter clothes
	I like the scarf and the cardigan
	But it'd be nice to have like big fuzzy coats and leg warmers and long fluffy stockings and beanie hats with the ear flaps or the animal faces
	Also more colors for the really long gloves
		I also want the option of buttoning up the jackets
	
	Speaking of the fast travel system and the mall, each shop should have a fast travel button back to the entrance.
	  It's actually confusing for the player when you leave a store to realize that you've been moved to another location, but don't have a fast button to get back like in the mansion.
	  after being done with pix in the gym the fast travel comes up and its very confusing because it does nothing so you have to move manually anyway
	
	Midair fucking while in flight
	
	kind of odd when brax gives you the potion, the resist options are available. 
	i mean, it says your being good and obident in fucking him, so, being able to resist seems a little silly
	
	Will there be an option during sex when you have pregnancy fetish.
		If she isnt pregnant yet you comment that you intend to "put a bun in her oven" if she is already pregnant you can tell her the look suits her or something like that. Or even just caressing her stomach when it grows enough.
	
	Dark Alleyways doesn't have any random drops (abandoned packages)
	
	add scars as a cosmetic thing for characters
	
	What I'm saying is that even if your nips are covered if the rest of your breasts are still out and exposed that's still skimpy/partially nsfw. There should be a bonus for that. It's literally stripper clothes.
		Over dressed > Dressed > under dressed > Skimpy > slutty > Exposed > Naked
	
	I will add foot fetish scenes soon! I won't replace those other fetishes, but I can definitely add a foot fetish to the available fetishes to take. ^^
	
	What if folks that you removed from a square showed up in the Police head quarters jail? IE you remove them by reporting them to the cops. And then the jails can sorta serve as a small log of your most recent NPC removals. Heh you could perhaps even change your mind about removal by "dropping your charges" against them perhaps.
	
	'wild' morphs instead of 'feral'
		Have ferals as actual animals
		The last pace I could possibly think of that would be worth adding would be "primal", in this case instincts have taken over completely, people in this state can't be reasoned with and do not talk.
			The sex itself would be rough with 2 possible goals either baby making or establishing dominance over a rival of the same gender (male/male, female/female, after all its the strong in nature that get the best picks). 
		
	Define custom NPCs.
	
	Angry high-power couriers that come back looking for their parcels, chance of encounter increasing with the items found in alleys
		
	players that choose the slut start should be able to select a gender preference feat.
		Seems like they'd have enough experience to know what they like.
		
	Masturbation fetish lead to positions and stuff like Mutual Masturbation or Frotting?
	
	Maybe an option when you pull out or whatever if you have cum stud and masturbation to pull out and cover them in cum completely?
		
	add a hyper fetish at some point that would unlock NPCs spawning in with sizes like that
	
	tribadism
	
	Multicolor hair
	
	strapons and double ended dildos
	
	Sandals and flipflops
	
	"Back to Wall" position, I think a "Carry" position would also be in order. You've already got their back against a wall, why not just hike their legs up and pound them into it
	
	Expand Harpy content:
	Something as simple as the option to skip one of the fights by letting that matriarch take the credit for pacifying the others, in exchange for a different reward than the cash, a special sex scene,
	 and that harpy's traits being more common among the random harpies would be plenty to make the quest more interesting.
	
	
		I'll add some kind of way to earn arcane essences while being a pure virgin, good idea! ^^

	- I like the idea of selling your body to your attacker. I'm going to add some more non-violent resolutions to those encounters, and that could be one of them!
	
	- I'll add an option to keep sex going while the sub, good idea!
	
	- The options in sex are very cluttered (and switch around a lot) at the moment. I'm going to be tidying all those up soon, and I'll split the different paces up into clearer sub-sections to make sure that there are no mis-clicks or anything. ^^
	
	
	What if, fetishes had a point system, instead of one off buying? 

	Like: breast fetish 1/5 (5% willpower damage per point when using breast deduction, 5% more will power damage taken from whatever the other version is)
	Then potential seduction skills could be tied into tiers ( breast tease at rank 1, titty drop at 3, breast smothering at 5 idk)
	It'd also differentiate characters who like something, and characters who are super into it.
	Potential an opposite like breast repulsion (reduces willpower damage from breast seduction by 5%)
	On another note, I'd be interested to see some more modifiers on base white gear, like crotchless panties giving willpower damage instead of damage reduction
	
	
	a romance fetish that makes a small percentage of NPCs hit on you/ initiate a conversation that may or may not lead to sex. Instead of trying to attack you?
	IE if an NPC has the fetish and they like your gender then they should skip combat/ offer conversation and consensual sex. If the PC takes the fetish that could perhaps increase the spawn rate of other romantics.
	
	
	I'd love a Shortstack named NPC to headpat without permission. I want her to get be all tsundere about it. Lol she might love the feeling but she's so insecure about her height that she thinks you're trying to rub in how easy it is for you to pat her head.
	And the moment she ever gets the slightest bit taller than the PC either from her growing or the PC shrinking it goes straight to her head and she starts patting the PC's head to rub in the fact that now she's taller.
	
	
	Combat suggestions:
	
	- I'll definitely add clothing tearing/stealing during combat.
	
	- I'm still working out exactly how combat will play out, but I'm toying with the idea of grappling/wrestling actions at the moment. They may or may not make it into the new combat system, but I do really like the idea of them!
	
	- Forcing sex without completely draining one of the combat resources sounds like a fun mechanic, but I wonder if it might make combat a little less clear for the player. (It would give them an extra thing to keep track of, and exhibitionists might be at a major disadvantage here.)
	
	- I like the idea of those really risky taunt moves! Giving the player an option to get on their knees and offer a blowjob could be a really fun thing to do during combat (especially if the NPC rushes forwards to take advantage of that offer :3).
	
	When I rework the combat, I'll be adding a lot more special moves and weapons, so I'll add things like 'pussy spread' and 'flash' then
	
	Hmm i wonder if maybe a more extreme version of the exhibitionist fetish the nudist fetish could be added.
		NPCs with that fetish would not wear any clothes except for basic jewlery and players with it would get a penalty for not exposing themselves enough
	
	
	Theres an information booth close to a wall with a female standing in it. Her job is to help you out with direction/information etc.
If she likes you enough she will hand you a pass that allows you to get into a door just around the corner, she says "Feel free to use what you find in there, ill be waiting~"
	
	Once the game gets further along, it would make sense for random NPCs to have progression if the player doesn't remove them.
	  They slowly level up over time, improve their gear, and transform themselves if their bodies don't match their preferences.
	    There can even be a system where NPCs that the player has a history with will hunt the player down, occasionally showing up as random encounters away from their normal tile.
	      Maybe they're trying to enslave the PC or continue transforming them, maybe they've become a rival of sorts and want to rematch, there are lots of possibilities.

	a lyanthropy fetish, where on the arcane storms we turn into a feral where-whatever we are
	
	I might expand the way fetishes work at some point in the future, but for now I thought it would be easier to have it so you could just choose which fetishes you like.

	By 'expand', I mean that I might (a lot later in development) make it so that performing fetish-related actions would 'level up' your fetishes into more powerful versions.
		e.g. Performing anal actions while having the anal fetish would 'level up' your anal fetish.
		
		
	Y'know what'd be nice? A way to bookmark randomly-generated characters you like. Ones that have fetishes you like, or ones that you've sunk some resources into TFing. It can be easy to forget which map square people hang out in.
	That's a good suggestion, but it would take me a long time to implement something like that, as there are lots of other things to do first ^^(edited)
	Perhaps have a note area in the cellphone for free-form note taking?
	Easiest option I can think of is to let the player 'add' a random NPC to their contact list.
	  It then references information about them and were they can be found.  Could also include any children information too.
	    If the player wants, they can remove these contacts at any time and they're also removed if the player removes that NPC from that area.
		
	1) A bit in relation to the kissing and lipstick suggestion. Perfume/Pheromones/Smells and maybe body licking (It is sometimes erotic). The perfume/pheromones/smells could have an effect both in combat and in random encounters. For example you could be secreting mating pheromones and someone might pick up on the invitation. It could cause status effects during combat.
	2) This one would probably work better for a single specific individual but its also in relation to the idea of people coming to your house. It would concern pregnancy fetishists (or races that are really into breeding like the bunnies and rats) specifically:
	Basically if you have a certain amount of virility, Penis+Testicle size and cum production and have sex with a pregnancy fetishist or one female member of that race but don't cum inside them they might find you again either out in the open world or at the house/camp. They would basically try to get you to have sex with them again but they make it clear they want you to finish inside. 
	The way they try to convince you could vary depending on the personnality of the NPC, some might try to provoke you by saying you couldn't do it even if you tried all day, some might try to fan your ego, some would ask up front what they are lacking for you to be interested.
	You would then have choices on how to answer to them, either you can choose to "take the bait" of their provocations etc, tell them you didn't feel like it but they could try to "convince you", make the "work" for it or even don't say anything and just breed them right then and there.
