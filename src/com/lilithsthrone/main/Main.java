			+"<ul>Added support for author attribution in modded clothing and weapons. As above, reference the rental_mommy.xml file to see how it works in clothing (line 11), or the 'res/weapons/innoxia/dagger/dagger.xml' for weapons (line 5).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Updated Weapon xml loading to use BlazingMagpie's xmlParsing Element structure.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Did some more optimisation of save files, cutting file size by about 10% on larger saves.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Added a 'Thorough wash' action to your room, which cleans out all of the fluids in your orifices.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Clothing which plugs or seals orifices no longer gets dirty from creampies which it is keeping sealed/plugged in. (This clothing can still get dirty if someone cums on it.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Half-demon harpies (furies) can now spawn in the harpy nests, and Submission attackers can also now be half-demons. Both are at a chance of 5% per encounter, and the chance for Dominion half-demon attackers has similarly been increased to 5% (from 2.5%).</ul>"
			+"<ul>By default, half-demons now need two orgasms to be satisfied in sex, while demons, lilin, and elder lilin need 3.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added ability to use the milking room's equipment to manually milk your companions or slaves assigned to it. You can also use the 'pump' actions on them.</ul>"

			+"<ul>You can now meet taur offspring in Dominion's alleyways.</ul>"

			+"<li>Contributors:</li>"

			+"<ul>Added: 'Evening gown' (feminine, torso slot, sold by Nyan). (PR#1097 by Phlarx)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added: 'Rockabilly dress' (feminine, torso slot, sold by Nyan). (PR#1097 by Phlarx)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added: 'Vintage dress' (feminine, torso slot, sold by Nyan). (PR#1097 by Phlarx)</ul>"

			+"<ul>Slaves given permission to wash their bodies will now clean all fluids out of their orifices.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Amber's walkies scene now ends with you being returned to the lounge, instead of the entrance hall.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added separate icon colours for demons and half-demons.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Added 'breast size' and 'penis size' preference modifiers to the 'Content options' screen (at the very bottom).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Increased chance of friendly  occupants finding a job each day from 10% to 20%.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Miscellaneous code cleanup.</ul>"
			+"<ul>A slave's value now takes into account the clothing they are wearing, as well as all items in their inventory.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The value of slaves is no longer increased by a fixed amount per fetish they have, and is instead multiplicative based on number of owned fetishes (+5% value per fetish).</ul>"

			+"<ul>Both types of rabbit ears, as well as floppy dog ears, can now be used in an 'ear pull' action in sex, which is functionally similar to the 'Twintail pull' action when receiving a blowjob from the targeted character, and similar to the 'Pull hair' action when fucking the character doggy-style. (Both require at least two hands to be free.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Did some more improvements to sex AI, removing yet more instances where NPCs would start/stop actions in sex.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Restricting/permitting self-actions should now be working correctly.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Stabilised lust changes by limiting it to +/-2.5 for each character on every character's turn (meaning that it has a maximum change of +/-5 per turn with 2 non-spectator participants, but +/-7.5 per turn with 3 non-spectator participants).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Removed restriction that was preventing two futa characters from simultaneously fucking one another.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Orgasming no longer resets arousal to 0, but instead to 25% of the cahracter's lust value.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Improved methods responsible for determining an NPC's willingness to deny requests, choose what action to take in sex, and the amount of arousal & lust gained from actions each turn.</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs with competing fetish desires (e.g. hating anal, but loving taking cock) will now sometimes be willing to perform those actions, and should not be losing arousal or lust as a result.</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs should no longer be choosing to perform actions which they dislike or hate.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added indication of sexual parts not tasting like normal. i.e. When performing an oral action on a vagina, penis, or nipples whose associated fluid does not taste like normal, then a line is appended to tell you what it tastes like.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Dominant NPCs will now always want to end sex if they have had over twice the number of orgasms they need to be satisfied.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Other:</li>"
			+"<ul><b>Altered:</b> Cum and milk regeneration is no longer based on a percentage of maximum storage, and is instead a fixed value from 0-1,000,000mL per day. As part of this change, regeneration values will be reset to default values when you load in.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Youko offspring can now be found in Dominion's back alleys, but I will move them out into the 'Shinrin highlands' area once I've added that content, so this is just temporary.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Renamed the 'skin' modifier in TF potion creation to 'torso', to make it clearer that it's only affecting the torso's skin.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Milk regeneration is now multiplied by the number of breasts a character has.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slightly altered value calculations for milk, cum, and girlcum. (Flavour now counts for a lot more.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Changed lion-morph icon to a standard recoloured cat-morph icon, as I wanted to keep subspecies icons as consistent as possible.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added 'cherry' flavour to fluids, changed 'slime' flavour to 'bubblegum', and improved enchantment icons for fluid modifiers.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Added description for when any fluid is ingested, to let you know exactly how much was pumped inside the orifice. (Mostly seen in sex when orgasm actions are used.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slave value now takes into account whether or not they are anal, vagina, and penis virgins. (Vagina and penis virginity value modifier only applies if they actually have a vagina or penis.)</ul>"

			+"<ul>Added bat-morph tail type.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed minor lore inconsistency in the intro regarding the arcane.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed inconsistent application of crotch-boob/udders content option. This option will now correctly only influence crotch-boob/udder creation on newly-spawned NPCs, and will not retroactively affect NPCs who already have crotch-boobs, nor interfere with TF potions that add/remove crotch-boobs.</ul>"
