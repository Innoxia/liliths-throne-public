			+"<li>Other:</li>"
			+"<ul>Slaves will now only be milked of their milk, cum, and girlcum if they are able to automatically equip their milking pumps. This requires access to nipple, penis, and vagina inventory slots (and the stomach slot for udders, if applicable).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added a setting for the 'milking' slave job, which is off by default, to allow hymen tearing (which can be caused by the dildo-like 'pussy pump').</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed incorrect formatting of percentage attribute values in clothing, weapon, tattoo, and item tooltips, as well as in the enchantment screen.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed selfie describing your age as starting as 18, even though the 'starting at 18' mechanic doesn't apply to the player.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where equip text that included conditional statements was being parsed during game initialisation or loading, which was throwing background errors.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where characters could still get pregnant/impregnate others even if they had the 'barren' or 'firing blanks' perks, or the 'menopause' status effect.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where half-demon centaurs would spawn in without having any demonic parts, which was causing several issues stemming from their resulting incorrect race recognition.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with slimes and elementals being describes as being 'covered in' slime, stone, flames, etc. instead of being 'made out of' the material.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where you could only save your save when your location's default dialogue was being displayed. (You can now save whenever your character is free to move.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where the spawn rate of taurs in Submission was being influenced by the half-demon spawn rate setting instead of the taur spawn rate setting.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Updated the lacy plunge bra icon. (by DSG)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed typos in plate carrier, heavy plate carrier, and combat helmet descriptions. (by DSG)</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Engine/Modding:</li>"
			+"<ul>Slightly decreased size of save files.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added accessor for RacialBody in parsing, using the 'RACIAL_BODY_' prefix. Also added 'getRacialBody()' method to Race class for access to RacialBodies.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added 'appendToTextStartStringBuilder' and 'appendToTextEndStringBuilder' methods to correctly parse text to the game's 'start' and 'end' StringBuilders (for use in mods that apply effects).</ul>"
			+"<ul>You can now define 'criticalHitText' values in weapon mods, which allow you to define hit descriptions which are only shown when critically hitting. (For an example, see 'res/weapons/innoxia/dagger/dagger.xml'.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added accessor for AbstractFluidTypes, using the 'FLUID_TYPE_' prefix. Added a version of the GameCharacter.ingestFluid() method which takes an AbstractFluidType instead of a FluidInterface (so it can be called via parsing). </ul>"
			+"<ul>Added a version of GameCharacter.calculateGenericSexEffects() which can be called from the parser. Added accessors for SexParticipantType ('SEX_PT_') and GenericSexFlag ('SEX_FLAG_') for use in this method.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The 'SPECIAL_PARSE' command should now work correctly as logic in conditional statements (it gets parsed before the conditional is checked).</ul>"

			+"<ul>Axel's quest (involving the Rat Warrens) is under construction again, and as such, I've disabled the ability to start his quest in this version. If you've already started it, then please wait until the next release before continuing with it!</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Balance:</li>"

			+"<ul>The chance for an Enforcer encounter to trigger in alleyway tiles has been increased from 2% to 2.5%.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The 5 alleyway tiles closest to Dominion's Enforcer HQ now have a significantly higher chance of generating Enforcer encounters than normal alleyway tiles (15% instead of 2.5%), while also having a lesser chance of generating a generic attacker encounter (10% instead of 15%).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Increased maximum shielding values from 100 to 500, and made it so that a value of 500 in any shielding category grants complete immunity from the related damage type. (Only used for fire and ice elementals being immune to fire/ice damage.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Removed the diminishing returns factor from all damage attributes and made it clear that these are referring to percentage increases wherever they're displayed (in tooltips and stats screen).</ul>"
			+"<ul>The 'spell efficiency' attribute is now capped at 80 instead of 100, and all damage attributes have a lower cap of -80 instead of -100.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Randomly-spawned NPCs will no longer have the 'martial artist' trait.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Items:</li>"

			+"<li>Sex:</li>"
			+"<ul>Added some flavour text for characters with the 'pure virgin' fetish (and who are either still vaginal virgins or have a regrown hymen) performing or receiving the 'pussy tease' sex action (with both penis or tail).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added some variation in the tail/penis-vagina penetration sex action descriptions for when the character being penetrated is still a virgin.</ul>"
			+"<ul>'Stop ongoing' actions are now coloured differently than the 'start ongoing' actions.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Other:</li>"
			+"<ul>You can now recolour human skin to any colour, just like with other covering types. (Humans will still only ever spawn with natural colours.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs' 'home' icons on the minimap are now semi-transparent to make it clearer that they aren't actually there.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Improved 'barren' and 'firing blanks' tooltip descriptions to make it clearer how those perks work.</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs who are not your slave, elemental, or one of your friendly occupants will now automatically spend their perk points when they level up (via draining your levels or gaining experience from beating you in combat).</ul>"
			+"<ul>When losing a level (from orgasmic level drain), characters now additionally lose a random perk if their perk points are reduced to below 0 in the process.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The clothing & weapons sold by Finch, Nyan, Kate, and Vicky are now generated in stacks of 2-6 instead of just 1.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added some pet names for use in Amber's scene where she walks you and you run into her friend & their pet.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Reduced the default capacity for several races' (reindeer, squirrel, rat, rabbit, and bat) vaginas, as they were still using values from before the penetration girth/depth rework.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Enforcers who choose to give you a handjob after the strip search will now only finger your asshole at the same time if they have a positive desire towards the anal-giving fetish.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Sex scenes no longer start with a spam of 'X area was already lubricated by Y' messages.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added more staircases to Lilaya's house.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The 'begin slave interaction' actions in Lilaya's house are now coloured according to the slave's femininity.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added setting to enable bad ends in gameplay content option (on by default). (There are no bad ends in the game just yet, but I may start adding some alongside new content in the future.)</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Bugs:</li>"
			+"<ul>Parsing fixes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed a minor issue where Finch, Kate, and Nyan would sometimes not generate the correct number/type of enchanted clothing for sale.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where having the 'opportunistic attackers' content setting turned on would cause some Encounters to never trigger.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where two human half-demons would create half-demon offspring instead of imps.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where demons/lilin who had transformed to look like a different race would create offspring of a subspecies based on their appearance, instead of their true demonic race.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where if you had the American tourist background perk, the conversion of colour to color was followed by a random pair of parentheses.</ul>"
			+"<ul>(Finally) Fixed issue where Scarlett would sometimes not appear in Helena's shop after sending her there during Helena's romance quest.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed related issue where Scarlett's location was not being set properly during the stage of the main quest where you need to buy her from Helena.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters who have lost their vaginal virginity and then regown their hymen now correctly have their new hymen torn in situations where they should be losing their virginity.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Formatting of attribute numbers in status effect tooltips no longer always has a trailing '.0'.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with the flow of dialogue in Amber's 'Insult her' scene.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Vargrs, hellhounds, and demonic-fox-morphs now correctly spawn in with red canine-like cocks.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where your character's health would sometimes keep on dropping during character creation.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed issue with half-demons who have a unique name not gaining any name variation when they were taurs.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where offspring would react as though you're enslaving them with a collar even if you used a different item of clothing.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed minor issue with outline colouration in the Enforcer's utility belt icon.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Engine:</li>"
			+"<ul>Slightly improved game's performance (by updating character status effect checks and removing some background parsing).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Reduced size of save files by about 800kB.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Gameplay:</li>"
			+"<ul><b>Companion content is now locked behind a toggle in gameplay options, and is disabled by default.</b> No further support for companions will be added going forwards, as accounting for companion variations, both in the writing and dialogue framework, was taking a huge amount of time and slowing down the pace of the game's development too much.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added full content for the Enforcer encounter, which can now trigger in both Dominion's canal and alleyway tiles. Increased the chance of this encounter triggering from 1% to 2%.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Balance:</li>"
			+"<ul>Martial artist perk now triples base unarmed damage.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Base unarmed damage is now calculated as 20% of a cahracter's physique, and is no longer capped at 8.</ul>"

			+"<ul>'Unarmed' weapons (such as the knuckle dusters) now include the equipping character's base unarmed damage in their damage calculation.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters now gain unique effects from non-flesh body materials, instead of the effects being part of the subspecies status effect. (Only affects slimes and elementals at the moment.)</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Elementals:</li>"
			+"<ul>Elementals no longer have two perks giving them their core stats, and instead have an 'Elemental' trait which does this.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Elementals' attributes are now determined by their body material, and are applied via their racial status effect.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Sex:</li>"
			+"<ul>When a character wearing a condom cums, and the condom doesn't break, they now pull out of whatever orifice they were fucking (so that they can remove the condom).</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs will no longer stop all ongoing 'foreplay' sex actions before starting their preferred 'main sex' penetrative action (if the action is available to them).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Disabling anal content now only disables actions involving a character's anus, not their ass. (So you can now perform/receive hotdogging even if anal is off.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs will now only suck their own tails during sex if they have both the performing and receiving oral fetishes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters who have the pure virgin fetish and a virgin vagina (or a regrown hymen) will now have a very strong aversion to performing sex acts that involve having their vagina penetrated. (This also affects sex type generation during quick sex.)</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Slavery:</li>"
			+"<ul>Slaves will no longer have sex with other slaves who aren't attracted to them, unless they are willing to rape that other slave. (Willingness to rape requires non-con content to be on and for the slave to have a non-negative fetish desire towards raping others.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slaves now have a chance (25%) to bond with one another for each hour that they spend together (either in the same room or at the same job). The chance to bond is reduced if the slaves are shy and increased if they are confident or related to one another.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Bonding events can either result in a positive or negative change to the slaves' affection towards one another. Being kind or related to one another increases the chance of a positive event, while being selfish decreases it.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slaves will now only masturbate after 12 hours of having the 'Pent-up' status effect, instead of 6, so (if their setting enable them to) they will be more likely to have sex with other slaves (or ambush the player for sex).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Improved information shown in slave job tooltips.</ul>"
