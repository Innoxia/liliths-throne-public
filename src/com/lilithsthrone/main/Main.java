			+"<li>Other:</li>"
			+"<ul>Slightly tweaked sex action preference weighting, so that an action which has both a 'liked' and 'disliked' fetish associated with it will now have a total slightly negative weighting, so it won't be chosen.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slightly changed the underwear worn by Alexandria (the prologue character in the museum).</ul>"
			+"<ul>The 'sadistic' sex actions ('degrading talk', 'choke', 'slap face', and 'spit in face') now apply a significant hit to the targeted character's lust if that targeted character doesn't have a positive desire for the 'masochist' fetish.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Provided you have enough control in the sex scene, you can now start ongoing actions with a partner's sex area even if they are using that sex area. (i.e. If your partner is fingering themselves, you can now start cunnilingus on them, which will automatically get them to stop fingering themselves.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>After selecting an orgasming action in sex, the game now restores your targeted character to the person you were targeting before orgasm, and puts you back into the tab you were on before (instead of putting you back into the default 'Misc. actions' tab after every orgasm).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Reformatted the stats screen to make it more readable.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added 'Grope breasts (self)' sex action, allowing characters to grope their own breasts during sex.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Removed the stopwatch icon overlay on combat move cooldown status effects, to make it clearer which effects are on cooldown.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added indication to clothing TF tooltips to make it clearer if the TF is applied to breasts or crotch boobs.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Bugs:</li>"
			+"<ul>Parsing fixes, including fixes to incorrect characters being referenced in all multiple-ongoing sex actions (such as vaginal/anal double-penetration).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed clover clamps and realistic dildo being able to be equipped onto/into a character's non-existent vagina.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where sex would softlock when a character was orgasming in the 'dominant standing' position.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters facing a wall can no longer grope the breasts of the person standing behind them.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issues with buying items, weapons, and clothing from vendors, where instead of the purchased item being placed into your inventory, it was being put into the buyback menu.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where trying to equip a condom while in Ralph's trade dialogue would cause an error to be thrown.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed Lilaya's panties masturbation scene missing its unique panty-related actions.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed Nyan's images displaying her 'gift' ones (which were intended for a later scene, and have been moved into a new 'NyanSpecials' folder).</ul>"
			+"<ul>You are no longer affected by the restricted areas you've set for any of your slaves in the public stocks. (So while members of the public will be unable to use their restricted areas, you can always do whatever you like with them.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where exporting characters would set their exported birth year as 3 years later than it actually is.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where NPCs would generate new special perks every time you loaded a game.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where resetting perk trees would remove the 'core' perks at the top of each column, making it impossible to select any new perks.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed some issues which would rarely cause NPCs to use incorrect actions when in group sex.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed start double penetration actions being displayed when targeting the character who's already fucking you.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed several issues with item, clothing, and weapon usage in masturbation scenes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed weapons in inventory not being displayed as disabled during sex.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with NPCs getting stuck trying to remove clothing in sex. (An example of this was NPCs not being able to figure out how to remove a corset dress while wearing a women's leather jacket.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where removing a character (via the 'Kick out' action for friendly occupants, for example) who was your companion would block you from adding any new companions to your party.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed issues with Brax's sex scenes sometimes using incorrect penetration descriptions.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed your name being displayed as 'You' in your character UI box during sex.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed sex with slaves/companions sometimes being erroneously described as 'rape' in the action title.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issues with companion sex always acting as though they were your slave.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where ongoing double penetration could sometimes result in the receiving orifice being described as continuously stretching, even if it was already stretched out to the maximum size.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed the rough and normal variations of clothing displacements being switched, so the game would display non-rough displacement descriptions when you were in the rough pace and vice-versa.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters who have a negative desire towards the pregnancy fetish will no longer force others to creampie them.</ul>"

			+"<li>Contributors:</li>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug in lying down position where when using reverse face-sitting, the sex scene would sometimes break. (PR#1200 by Sphilia)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where quadruple slave room upgrades would instead be showing upgrades for the double slave room. (PR#1196 by EPSIL0N)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added support for clover clamps and realistic dildo to be equipped in sex, and to not conceal the vagina. Also added support for slaves to gain experience from working at their job. (PR#1201 by Norin)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issues with slave/occupant selection when choosing who to have sex with in rooms in Lilaya's house. (PR#1205 by EPSIL0N)</ul>"

			+"<li>Items:</li>"
			+"<ul>Renamed 'knightly sword' to 'arming sword', and added a sheathed icon for when it's not equipped.</ul>"

			+"<li>Combat:</li>"
			+"<ul>All characters involved in combat now perform their moves simultaneously (so even if you defeat an enemy, they still get to perform their selected moves). If combat results every participant being defeated, it counts as your victory.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Instead of having only 8 combat moves being available at once, you can now select 8 'core' combat moves (which can be selected/deselected just like before), while moves which are not designated as 'core' are still available during combat, but suffer a +1 AP cost, and also have a +1 turn cooldown.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added 'commands' tab in combat, which contains actions that allow you to give your companions attack-type orders. (The possible commands are: balanced, attack, defend, seduction, spells, and support.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed numerous issues with item usage during combat. Using an item now costs 1 AP, and items can no longer be used while defeated or stunned.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Removed ability to manipulate clothing and weapons in combat, as it was causing several issues with the underlying mechanics. (I'll try to enable this again at some point when I have time to add proper support and actions for it all.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added ability to equip a weapon in each one of your hands, based on how many arm rows you have, up to a total of 6 weapons at once. (The inventory UI changes layout to show a character's extra weapon slots only if they have more than one arm row.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Renamed the combat move 'twin strike' to 'all-out strike'.</ul>"
			+"<ul>'Strike', 'Offhand strike', and 'All-out strike' now have their AP cost equal to how many arm rows you have, with a maximum AP of 3.</ul>"
			+"<ul>'All-out strike' no longer has any damage reductions on the weapons involved, but has a cooldown of two turns (including the turn in which it's used).</ul>"
			+"<ul>'Arcane strike' no longer uses your primary weapon to calculate damage, and instead deals lust damage to your target equal to 10% of the aura you recover. Aura recovery is calculated by: 2*level</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs will no longer use the 'bite' special attack if their mouth is blocked, nor any special tease attacks if they are completely ineffective (either due to missing aprts or the enemy not liking the associated fetish).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Buffed fetish tease attack critical damage, making it a lot more effective than regular critical tease attacks. (The non-crit damage is still slightly weaker than regular tease attacks.)</ul>"

			+"<li>Other:</li>"
			+"<ul>Added 'German-shepherd-morphs' as a subspecies of dog-morph. A character needs upright dog ears, as well as fluffy black fur with tan markings to be identified as a German-shepherd-morph.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters no longer respond to spectating characters' encouragements to pullout or creampie, and you, the player, also no longer responds to these encouragements from anybody (as the game doesn't know if you're going to pull out or not...).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added kissing actions to cowgirl position, and breasts-to-mouth interactions for missionary.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The heavy muffling in sex (where all words are replaced with '~Mrph~' noises) is now only caused if the character is wearing clothing which impedes speech, or if the character is performing oral on a penis, tail, or tentacle. (So kissing no longer causes speech to be totally muffled.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Dirty talk and other similar speech-type sex actions are now available even if the character is performing oral, so long as it's not on a penis, tail, or tentacle.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added a 'face between legs' slot to the lying down position, so characters can now perform oral on characters who are lying down.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Imps now have a significant lust damage debuff (to represent both their uncouth mannerisms and their reputation as being on the very bottom rung of Dominion society).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Obedient slaves now have appropriate descriptions when you give them an item to consume/use.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Increased the chance of finding 'Glowing Mushrooms' when exploring the 'Bioluminescent Cavern' tiles.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added icons to responses in sex to indicate if they're going to swap ongoing actions or have you join in as an additional ongoing character.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slightly improved ordering of sex actions, based on their associated pace.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Improved buyback menu to correctly handle stacks of sold items/clothing/weapons.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slightly improved flow of dialogue in Candi's scenes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added in variations of orgasm requests and denials for characters who have muffled speech.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Converted breeding stall position into new positioning format.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Increased value of slaves who still have their virginity.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Slightly rebalanced NPCs' sex action preference weighting, so it's now a little more likely that NPCs will prefer to use non-vaginal or anal actions in sex (although those two remain weighted heavier than other actions).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Pregnancy status effects now apply a small reduction in maximum health.</ul>"

			+"<li>Bugs:</li>"
			+"<ul>Fixed several parsing errors and typos.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed formatting and description errors in ongoing double-penetration action text (for both vaginal and anal).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where the 'Characters Present' screen would sometimes throw an error if you had no companion in your party.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with the 'Dominate' action in the Father's day content's threesome scene not working, and a related issue with the reverse cowgirl position causing sex to sometimes break.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The 'Encourage Pullout' action is no longer available if the orgasming character is currently unable to pull out. (i.e. If they're leg-locked, tail-locked, etc.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed combat bug where the offhand attack was calculating damage based on the weapon you had in your main hand.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issues with Brax being your slave, where his/her clothing would re-equip itself after sex, and several descriptions related to him/her acting as though he was still at the Enforcer Headquarters. Also fixed issues with his/her sex paces and perk tree not working correctly.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug in sex where a character could end up using their tongue and mouth on different areas at the same time (such as performing cunnilingus while also sucking on a tail).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed positioning bug where a character could access a slot that would normally be banned once they'd moved out of their currently-assigned slot.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed some issues with the positioning menu which were resulting in broken parsing and sometimes causing the game to freeze.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where entering the positioning menu would sometimes put characters in slots that shouldn't have been available to them.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where post-combat sex actions were sometimes disabled, even if the dialogue indicated that the NPC wanted to have sex with you.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Rough sex action that target yourself (such as rough self-fingering) now correctly have the masochist fetish associated with them.</ul>"
			+"<ul>NPCs will no longer use self-targeting sex actions which take their own virginity (they will still use actions that take their virginity if they are interacting with another partner).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Rose should no longer self-penetrate with her tail in her sex scene.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Leg transformations into taurs (via TF potions or the self-TF demon/slime menu) will no longer change the attributes of lower body parts (such as penis size, vagina capacity, etc.). It *will* still change all lower body parts into the corresponding race of the leg type, however.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Lyssieth's speech can no longer be affected by any drunk status effect she might have obtained while in her vision scene.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Dominion attackers which spawn during a storm on non-alleyway tiles will no longer have the 'talk' action available after defeating them, which was causing them to get permanently stuck as non-interactive NPCs on that tile. NPCs stuck in this manner will be automatically cleaned up when loading into this version.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed Ms. Cunningham's sex preferences when in the scene in which she's in the 'over-desk' position.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Enchantment capacity cost is no longer displayed for unidentified clothing.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed error with dates displaying 11th, 12th, and 13th as 11st, 12nd, and 13rd.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed telepathic seduction always being described as affecting you, even if it was an NPC targeting another NPC.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Repositioning when in a 'stocks' or 'milking stall' sex position no longer moves the characters locked into the stocks into a spectator slot.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where equipped/unequipped weapon icons would sometimes have gradients incorrectly coloured.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with the demon dagger's icon. </ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug in combat where NPCs would have their cooldowns reduced by 2 turns each turn instead of by 1.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Jhortrax and Fyrsia (the imp fortress leaders) now correctly prefer to use melee attacks rather than trying to seduce you in combat.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue in sex where two characters couldn't be simultaneously giving one another blowjobs (only noticeable in the 69 position).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issues with incorrectly configured sex area interactions when in the sixty nine position.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed some old position-related actions no longer being available for use (such as slap ass & position changing actions in stocks scenes, and some other minor ones in others).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Restored some old position-related orgasm climax descriptions which were accidentally removed as part of the sex positioning refactor work.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Spells which critically hit now correctly have the duration of any applied status effects doubled. Status effect duration is also now correctly doubled if the caster has the 'Arcane Composition' perk (from the musician background).</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed fire spells performing critical hits when they were the only spell selected, instead of the intended condition of the caster being under 25% health.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed numerous damage calculation errors in all special attacks derived from anthropomorphic body parts.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed a few parsing and description errors related to the combat move display screen.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed incoming tease damage not being correctly converted to health/mana damage when under the effect of the 'desperate for sex' status effect.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Applied temporary fix to status effect tooltip descriptions not wrapping around onto the next line (which was causing them to trail off outside of the tooltip). This might cause other slight formatting issues with status effect tooltips until I can get the time to come back and fix it properly.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed 'futanari testicles' content option incorrectly being applied to just feminine characters instead of just characters with a vagina.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters who dislike the pregnancy fetish will no longer force their partners to cum inside their vagina.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The offspring map can now be used on tiles which already have one character on them.</ul>"
			+"<ul>If multiple characters are on the same tile (such as a random alleyway attacker and one of your offspring spawned via the offspring map), encounters on that tile will now be randomly chosen from all characters present, instead of being the same character every time.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where randomly generated hostile characters (such as those on alleyway tiles, submission's tunnels, harpy nests, etc.) who were spawned in an older version would not have their location correctly set as their home location.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where some items were displaying incorrect equip/displace/unequip text. (This was also causing the effects of some modded clothing to not work.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>Spectators in sex can no longer manage the clothing of the actual participants.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed incorrect descriptions in taur transformation text, as well as in some orgasm scenes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue in several sex positions (mainly in the 'sitting' position) where only self-interacting sex actions would be available.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed deflowering fetish experience not incrementing from taking others' virginities unless you had the fetish.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed performing handjobs not being available while performing intercrural on the same person.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed bug where characters were spawning in with just 5 aura, even if their maximum aura was far higher.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Selling items no longer puts those items into the shopkeeper's inventory, and only puts them into the buyback menu.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed the buyback menu's broken UI, and fixed the 'buy (5)' and 'buy (all)' actions to work properly.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed being able to switch ongoing actions with Lyssieth in the Lilaya/Meraxis transformation scene, which would cause them to not be transformed, breaking the scene.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue where asking someone (who is listening to your requests) to pullout would cause them to always choose to cum on the floor, instead of sometimes choosing to cum on a body part.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed NPCs not prioritising character they are penetrating with their penis when choosing an orgasm action.</ul>"

			+"<ul>You are no longer blocked from masturbating if you have a summoned elemental in your party.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed raven harpies not being recognised if the harpy had 'pitch black' feathers instead of just 'black'.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Fixed bug where characters in the breeding stall could finger themselves.</ul>"
