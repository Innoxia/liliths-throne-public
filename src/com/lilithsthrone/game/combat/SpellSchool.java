				+ " Perhaps due to these lucrative applications, the school of Earth is the most widely-practised and popular of all the arcane schools."
			+ "</p>"
			+ "<p>"
				+ "A prerequisite to harnessing Earth spells is the ability to freely manipulate solid, non-organic matter."

				+ "The school of fire, much as its name would suggest, is purely focused on summoning arcane fire."
			+ "</p>"
			+ "<p>"
				+ "While arcane fire is employed in smelting and other heat-intensive industries, its many combat applications has given the school of Fire a rather poor reputation in demon society, which regards it as distasteful and crude."
				+ " Due to this, the only demons who choose to study the school of Fire are those who are interested in arcane research, those who are directly involved in heat-intensive industries, or those who expect to do a lot of fighting."

				+ "Focused on harnessing the most pure form of arcane energy, the spells in the school of Arcane are concerned with either influencing a person's lust, or performing extremely powerful miscellaneous abilities."
			+ "</p>"
			+ "<p>"
				+ "As the only publicly-available spells are the ones associated with influencing lust, the school of Arcane is overlooked by most demons, as their physical charms are more than adequate on this front."
				+ " The vast majority of the students of the school of Arcane can be found in the ranks of the cult of Lilith, who view this school as the one favoured by Lilith herself."
			+ "</p>"
			+ "<p>"
				+ "Once a prospective student has a basic grasp of Arcane spells, they will find that they're able to feel the ebb and flow of the arcane currents woven throughout the world,"
