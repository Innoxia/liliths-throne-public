I mean as long as they have the womb tattoo things that all those young demons have these days

I want glowing tattoos that show through fur so i can find them in a crowded area (they would be naked)

For tattoos we have ying yang symbols random english words or kanji

tattoos of penises not just ones on penises

One idea i had was that you can tattoo any combination of letters or numbers and have it described as being in one of several fonts, stylised curly or straight and bold for example

I mean perhaps you could have an option like Free Cities
	as in you can type in the description of a tattoo
	
A magical tattoo that is an image of an npc. it does not have their description instead it is described as: a tattoo of [name] from the side magically enchanted to show their appearance even if it changes
	It could also be of  you  that you give to an npc or put on yourself for selfception
	(Live updating tattoo of PC)
	
Basic animal tattoos Foxes dragons horses wolves sheep goats and badgers

I got idea for tatto, how about a wolf howling at the moon?

the generic "heart with mom printed across it", but with incest variations as well

A kitsune tattoo and an ankh tattoo

or at least 9 tails as a tattoo

some pregnancy fetish themed text tattoos would be appreciated: "baby factory", "breeder", etc

What about an enchanted tattoo that shows how many days until you're able to deliver

And an enchanted tally-counter showing how many times you've been pregnant/had sex

Oh, what about variable text tattoos? Like the pregnancy countdown tattoo could have accompnying text that changes every day
	Like one day it says something normal like "days/hours until birth" and then the next day it says something like "time until the next stud can knock me up"
	
Characters with a bimbo fetish should be able to get their own name tattood somewhere on their body that they have to check every time they introduce themselves

flames

Counter for children birthed

Count down until birth
That changes what the timer says, so one time it'ss say "Time until birth" and later it'll say something like "Time until the next hung stud can knock me up"
