	<!-- If any of the slots defined in this section are blocked (due to the character's body not supporting clothing in these slots), then the slot is counted as being equipped with an item of clothing from this set.
	For example, as the leg slot is defined in this section, a character with a taur's body (which is therefore blocked from wearing leg clothing) would have the 'numberRequiredForCompleteSet' reduced by 1.
	It's usually best to fill out this section with each slot that can be fitted with an item of this set's clothing.
	Possible slots are found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/master/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/inventory/InventorySlot.java-->
