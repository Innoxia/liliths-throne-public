	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	This is just a small hotfix to address some annoying bugs that made it into the last version. I still have several more bugs to fix, but they're just very minor ones, so I thought that they can wait until the next version. Thank you all again for your support, and I'll see you again soon!
</p>

	<b>Please note:</b> You can transfer your saved games, exported characters, saved enchantments, and transformation presets from previous versions into new versions simply by copying the contents of your 'data' folder into the new version's 'data' folder!

	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar! If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog.
