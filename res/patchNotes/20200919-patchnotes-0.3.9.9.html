<h2>v0.3.9.9</h2>
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Starting Claire's teleportation side-quest now requires you to have first completed the 'Slime Queen' side quest. (As I felt as though it was a little out of character for the Enforcers to let a stranger see the teleportation pads.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Items:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>(For Clothing Modding) If multiple stickers in one sticker category are set to be the default sticker, one of these default stickers is now chosen at random to be used for an item of clothing, instead of always the last defined default sticker.</li>
	<li>Made the shoulder strap on the 'ragged chest wrap' a sticker option.</li>
	<li>'Impish Brew' now grants +25 corruption to potion effects, instead of +50.</li>
	<li>Added ability to enchant clothing with vagina and penis addition and removal effects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can no longer 'Encourage creampie' or 'Encourage pullout' when spectating in a 'hidden' position (such as when you watch your slaves having sex in the alleyway or hallway encounters).</li>
	<li>You can now use level drain on orgasming characters while in a spectator slot.</li>
	<li>Added interactions in the 'Sitting' position between the 'Sitting in lap' slot and the 'Between legs' slot.</li>
	<li>Added interactions in the 'Over Desk' position between the 'Lying back' slot and the 'Bent over' slot.</li>
	<li>Added kissing and groping interactions between dominant and submissive standing characters in the 'Standing' sex position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The output of all parsing commands embedded within speech should now be correctly modified by any speech-altering effects (such as a slovenly character pronouncing 'her' as ''er').</li>
	<li>Transformative potions which turn a character's lower body into a taur now correctly transform all of the body parts which are affected (all parts below the waist) into their default animal counterpart states.</li>
	<li>Added transformation actions to alleyway prostitutes' post-combat victory scene.</li>
	<li>Added pregnancy reactions to Murk's greeting dialogue while in Epona's tile.</li>
	<li>Standardised sorting of all racial transformation options by their race name.</li>
	<li>Half-demons no longer use the same outfit generation as dark alleyway demons, and dark alleyway demons now have a 5% chance to spawn with demon daggers instead of 50%.</li>
	<li>The 'Enforcer HQ' tile is no longer considered to be dangerous during an arcane storm.</li>
	<li>Increased the chance of the street encounter in which Wes's quest starts from 10% to 50%.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Choosing to dominantly fuck Murk in Epona's tile (after completing Axel's quest) should now start with both of you in the intended positions.</li>

	<li>Fixed background errors being thrown if you decided to spam-click the 'New Game' action.</li>
	<li>Added a 'no preference' option to Scarlett's sex scene (where you act as her servant in Helena's nest), so that if you have no areas available for her to fuck, you no longer get stuck in that scene.</li>
	<li>Added actions to exit Helena's apartment at the entrance tile (for if you somehow manage to get stuck in there).</li>
	<li>Elementals now have the correct arcane storm status effect applied to them.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where you could swap position with Murk's milkers during sex with them.</li>
