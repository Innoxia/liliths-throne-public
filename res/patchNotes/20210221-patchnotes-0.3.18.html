<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>

	<li>Added support for use of spaced 'ELSE IF' in conditional statements (although you should probably still continue to use 'ELSEIF' for style conformity).</li>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added Nyan content up to the point where you can repeatedly go on weekend dates with her (and her mother).</li>
	<li>Added 'aristocrat' as a background choice during character creation.</li>
	<li>Reworked Pix's gym so that exercising no longer drains health, and instead applies a 'post-workout fatigue' status effect. Exercising in the gym now also grants progress towards unlocking physical perk points.</li>
	<li>You can now free your slaves by purchasing a Freedom Certification from Finch and then choosing the 'Set Free' action in your slave's management dialogue. If your slave likes you and you have a free guest room, you can have your slave become a guest after freeing them.</li>
	<li>You can now import characters as guests in the same way that you can import them as slaves. To do so, go to the waiting room in City Hall and use the 'Lodgers' action. Importing guests requires you to have a free guest room in Lilaya's mansion for them to move into.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Body:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The property of a vagina to birth live young or lay eggs can now be modified via the self-TF menu and/or by crafting TF potions.</li>
	<li>The orifice plasticity value of 'accommodating' now results in the orifice returning to 98% of its original tightness after being stretched, instead of 100%. (So the bottom 4 plasticity values now return to 100%, while the top 4 progressively return to lesser percentages.)</li>
	<li>Alligator tails are no longer marked as 'prehensile', and panther tails are marked as 'prehensile' (so that they can be used in sex if you have furry tail penetration turned on).</li>
	<li>Tails which are marked as suitable for penetration, but which are not prehensile, can now be used in sex so long as they are greater than 50% of the owner's height.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Characters in a 'performing oral' or 'missionary' slot in the 'lying down' sex position can now interact with the characters lying to either side of their target.</li>
	<li>Characters who are reverse face-sitting can now interact with characters who are scissoring the person whose face they are on.</li>
	<li>When using quick-sex, characters will no longer lose their vaginal virginity while tribbing with a clit that's not large enough to act as a pseudo penis.</li>
	<li>Characters with a positive desire towards the self-denial fetish no longer lose affection if they end sex without any orgasms, so long as they have been denied at least once (ending sex with no orgasms or denials still incurs an affection hit).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>

	<li>Added indication of the covering's race to covering recolouring menus.</li>
	<li>Brax now starts with 150 essences, so he can use his pistol a lot more.</li>

	<li>When purchasing or otherwise gaining ownership of a slave, you now gain keys to all of their equipped clothing which provides a key (such as their slave collar).</li>
