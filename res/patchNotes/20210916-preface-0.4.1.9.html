	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	Sorry about how long it's taken me to get this update out. I got carried away while adding the first NPC to Elis's shopping precinct, and the implementation of what should have been a small, simple side quest ballooned out into a whole new area with several types of content.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Please be aware that there is a lot of placeholder dialogue in this version!</b> I'll get the writing finished for the next update, which will be the public release of 0.4.2.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar! If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog. ^^
