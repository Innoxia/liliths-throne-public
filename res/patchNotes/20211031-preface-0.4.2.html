	Hello once again,
</p>

<p>
	I'm really sorry about how long it's taken me to get this update out. As mentioned in the latest post on my blog and SubscribeStar, I've been having a rough time since the last update, and progress on LT really suffered. Thankfully I'm past that now, and so I'll be able to get updates out in a more timely fashion from here on out.
</p>

<p>
	For what little time I had to work on this version (due to the issue mentioned above), I focused on fixing some bugs and getting Monica's quest completely finished. I also added a small Halloween event out in the Foloi Fields, where you can encounter a 'headless horseman' at night during the in-game month of October. Adding this encounter took time away from finishing the writing in Evelyx's Dairy, so there are still some placeholders to be found in there. I'll have that finished for the next update, along with getting more bugs fixed and PRs merged.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you all for your patience during this lengthy pause in updates, and I'll hopefully be releasing the next update very soon!
</p>

	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar! If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog.
