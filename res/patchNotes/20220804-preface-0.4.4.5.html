	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	Thank you for your patience while waiting for me to get this version finished. I should have had it released to you a while ago, but I kept on having to delay it for a few reasons:
	<br/>- Reworks of the new main quest content (I added a new character after 'finishing' it, then I completely reworked the map and thus the dialogues to go with it).
	<br/>- Writing simply took a lot longer than I expected (again).
	<br/>- Some unexpected family issues taking up some of my time.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, the release is out now, and better late than never I suppose. For this version I've added quite a few new items, clothing, and weapons, several bugs have been fixed, the next stage of the main quest has been added, and there's new artwork for Leotie (Nyan's mum) from FriendlyAlienFriend! I'm planning now on getting the placeholders filled in and then releasing the public version of v0.4.5 within about a week. There probably won't be too much else in it other than bug fixes and some minor additions.
</p>
