<p>
	<b>Important note:</b> The previous update (0.4.0.10) included the following bug fix:
	<br/><i>'NPCs who have sexual histories with the player are now fully deleted when removed from the game, instead of simply being moved to the generic holding tile. This will retroactively apply when loading into this version, and should help to cut down on save file size and end turn lag.'</i>
	<br/>While I've done a lot of testing of this, there is the possibility that it might end up having unintended effects (possibly of the same severity as the game-breaking bugs in v0.4.0.5 and v0.4.0.6). Just to be safe, <b>I advise you to make a backup of your saves before loading into this version, in case this bug fix damages your save file in some way!</b> If you do encounter such an issue, please let me know about it and I'll get it fixed as a priority.

	Hello once again,

<p>
	There's still a lot of placeholder content in this version. I'll get another one out as soon as I can!
