	<b>NOTE FOR THIS VERSION:</b> Loading into this version might take a little longer than usual as the old save format needs to be converted into a new offspring save format. After a long load, it might be a good idea to make a new save right away, to avoid this delay next time the game is loaded.

	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	I'm really sorry for this version's long delay and lack of content; I've had some personal issues going on over the past month, which has made it very difficult to find time in which to work on Lilith's Throne. I should be completely back on track for the new year, so I'll try to get back to a more regular release schedule then.
</p>

<p>
	The main things added in this version are the characters in Wall's End, as well as a large contribution from AceXP that should significantly improve the game's performance for saves in which you have a lot of unmet offspring.
</p>

<p>
	The next release will be either a small preview hotfix or the full public release of v0.4.3, which will hopefully be out in the first week of January.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar!
