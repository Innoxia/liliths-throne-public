<h3>Gameplay:</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>

	<li>Added a minor description variation for vaginal orgasms that are triggered while engaged in tribbing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Appended a numerical value to affection descriptions in the character view screen, so that it's easier to track exactly what affection values an NPC has towards you and other NPCs.</li>
	<li>A character's testicles' covering type is now determined by the testicle type's defined covering, instead of using the character's torso covering type.</li>

	<li>Fixed some formatting issues with tattoo descriptions at the bottom of the selfie/character view page when the tattoo had no writing or a 'none'-type counter.</li>

	<li>When getting a demonic or youko sexual partner to grow a penis during sex via use of the 'Grow cock' action, their penis skin colour should now match their race, unless it's been previously set to a different colour.</li>
