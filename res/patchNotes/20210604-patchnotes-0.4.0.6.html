<h2>v0.4.0.6</h2>

<h3>Contributors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Deprecated the toc.xml in favour of file name based sorting for patch notes. (PR#1537 by Stadler76)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Typo fixes.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where NPCs would not be present in their intended home cells when creating a new game, which was affecting all unique NPCS, most noticeably harpies and shop keepers in the Shopping Arcade. If you made a new game in 0.4.0.5, I'd advise starting over as I haven't retroactively fixed these NPCs being in incorrect tiles (as it would take a long time to go through them all and check where they're meant to be).</li>
	<li>The underarm content toggle should now correctly disable the availability of armpit actions in sex.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where exiting Dominion into the world map would sometimes place you in the last world map location you'd been in instead of the Dominion tile.</li>
	<li>Removed the 'Masturbate' action when accepting Meraxis's duel (which I was using for debugging purposes but forgot to remove it for the release).</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with Meraxis's post-kiss actions' tooltips incorrectly stating that sex areas were inaccessible.</li>
	<li>Fixed a couple of bugs related to the issue where trying to use the centaur transport back to Dominion from Elis would not work correctly.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where you had to use the 'Wait' action twice at the Elis centaur depot for Astrapi or Vronti to appear.</li>
	<li>Fixed another centaur depot issue where the 'Introduction' scene would replay when using the 'Wait & enter' action at the Dominion depot.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where Astrapi or Vronti would get stuck on the depot tile at ELis when choosing the decline their offer of a ride.</li>
	<li>Fixed (the final) issue with centaur transports where the time would not progress properly on your route to/from Dominion when travelling during the hour of 06:00.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where the game would sometimes become unresponsive when more than one generic NPC spawned on the same tile (which happened most often when Enforcers were spawned).</li>
	<li>Fixed some slight awkwardness in the flow of dialogue when looking at the calendar in your room.</li>
</ul>
