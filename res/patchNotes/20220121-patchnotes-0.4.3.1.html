	<li>Fixed issue where newly generated offspring would be of a random subspecies if they were meant to be a half-demon. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where sometimes starting lust would be zero for newly spawned encounters instead of at their resting lust level. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where if a character was immobilised then no orgasm options would be available for them to choose from, which led to a blank action grid being displayed to the immobilised player when a character reached orgasm. (PR#1638 by miome)</li>
	<li>Added support for instantiating all NPC classes via the addNPC(String npcGenerationId, String parserTarget) method by using predefined names (like FieldsBandit) or qualified names (like dominion.DominionAlleywayAttacker).
