<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for world and place types to define whether walls are present (which enables the 'against wall' sex position).</li>
	<li>Added support for sex actions to be applied at the start of sex when using the sexVariables element in responses.</li>
	<li>Added framework for external sex manager support, granting significantly more control over how sex scenes play out. (You can see a commented example in 'res/sex/innoxia/managers/meraxis/duel/masturbation.xml')</li>
	<li>Added framework for external sex action support. (You can see a commented example in 'res/sex/innoxia/actions/meraxis/duel/orgasm_panties_cum.xml')</li>
	<li>When defining dialogue nodes, added the ability to copy responses from another dialogue node instead of having to copy+paste them. (Done by using 'copyFromDialogueId' attribute in the 'responses' element.)</li>
	<li>Improved the 'random' parsing command so that empty strings are discarded from the potential returns, allowing you to use conditional statements to allow or remove strings from the randomly selected pool.</li>
	<li>Added new CoverableArea value 'ARMPITS', and applied this value to all applicable blocked body parts for 'torso over' and 'torso under' clothing in the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
