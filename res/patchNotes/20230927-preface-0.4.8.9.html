	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	I've got the next stage of the main quest content added for this version, as well as a new sex toy shop location in Dominion. I've also added a new 'doll' race, which took a while to implement due to having quite a few unique aspects to them. I'd planned on having these dolls (which will be sold at the new sex toy shop) available for you to buy as a type of slave for this release, but the sex toy shop content took longer to add than I expected, so the doll purchasing will be added for the next version.
</p>

<p>
	There's also new art for Oglix & Golix (the succubus and her elemental in 'The Crossed Blades' tavern in Elis) by Friendly Alien Friend, and art for Fae & Silvia (the fox-taur sisters in the Farmer's Market in Elis) by Pusspuss. There are also some new items, a small extension of Jules's content, and a lot of bug fixes.
</p>

<p>
	For the next version, I'm going to be focusing on finishing the doll purchasing content, adding the side quest for the succubus involved in the new stage of the main quest, and adding content for Silence & Shadow. I'm also going to finally be working on fixing the wiki, so progress towards the next version might be a little slow at first while I get that sorted out.
