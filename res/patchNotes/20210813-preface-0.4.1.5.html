	Hello once again,
</p>

<p>
	As mentioned in the previous update, this version has been focused mainly on fixing bugs, merging PRs, and getting the next stage of the main quest added. I'm going to move on to getting more of Elis's content added for the next release, which I hope to have out within a week or two from this release.

	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar! If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog. ^^
