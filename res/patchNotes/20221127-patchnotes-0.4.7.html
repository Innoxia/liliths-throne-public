</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Skirts now need to be pulled up to access the 'thighs' area.</li>
	<li>Improved method for determining which extra items of clothing need to be removed before an item of clothing can be removed, which should prevent issues where items of clothing were blocking one another's removal.</li>
	<li>Improved tooltip for when unequipping/displacing clothing is disabled, so that it tells you which other item of clothing is responsible for preventing the clothing from being unequipped/displaced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The 'Automatic stripping' content option no longer causes spectating NPCs to be stripped a the start of sex.</li>
	<li>Characters who are in the 'resisting' pace during sex will now correctly respond to an orgasm denial by using the 'Denied!' action.</li>
	<li>When removing the seal on an item and then taking it off during sex, the auto-equip after the sex scene will now trigger the item's sealed state, thereby re-sealing it back onto the character.</li>
	<li>The 'Customer approaches' sex action in Ralph's oral sex scene will now only trigger once every two turns at maximum.</li>
	<li>NPCs will now only equip chastity devices on their sexual partners if they either like or love the denial fetish.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Slightly improved colours in clothing/tattoo UI.</li>
	<li>The clothing types (such as sex toys and BDSM gear) which NPCs spawn with are now more randomly selected, which should result in NPCs spawning with a broader range of sex toys.</li>

	<li>Added tooltips for colours to the 'Add tattoo' UI.</li>

</ul>

	<li>Fixed issue where if an NPC's 'pet name' was 'Mr./Mrs./Miss X', it would not automatically change based on their femininity.</li>
	<li>Slaves who are only wearing milking equipment will no longer be described as taking off their clothes prior to being inspected.</li>

	<li>Fixed issue where enchanting an item of clothing which had name prefix or postfixes (such as '(flowers)' or '(blossom)' for the kimono) would duplicate the enchantment prefix/postfix.</li>
