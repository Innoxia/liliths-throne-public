<p>
	Hello once again!
</p>
<p>
	First of all, I'm sorry about how long it's been since the previous update. Some personal issues which continued through December and January meant that I wasn't able to work on LT as much as I normally do, but that's over now and so the next updates should be released more regularly.
</p>

<p>
	As for what's in this version, there are a lot of bug fixes and minor additions to the game. There's no large content additions, but I'm going to be focusing on that front for the next few releases, with more main quest content and side character content expansions being the focus.
</p>

<p>
	There's also new art for three characters in this version. FriendlyAlienFriend (https://twitter.com/thealienfriend) has created art for Vanessa/Ms. Cunningham, while Davyn (https://twitter.com/davyndraw) has created art for both Kalahari and Kruger.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you all for your patience and support during this long period since the last release. I'll do my very best to get the next version released within two weeks of this update!
</p>
