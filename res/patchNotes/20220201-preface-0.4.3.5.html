	<b>NOTE FOR THIS VERSION:</b> If you're loading in from a pre-v0.4.2.5 save into this version, then the loading time might take a little longer than usual as the old save format needs to be converted into a new offspring save format. After a long load, it might be a good idea to make a new save right away, to avoid this delay next time the game is loaded.

	Hello again!
</p>

<p>
	In this version I've mainly been focused on fixing bugs, adding some new sex content, and merging some PRs. There is also more of AceXP's new content added into this version, which includes more Harpy Nest sex options and a new dungeon map beneath Lilaya's mansion. I ran out of time in which to add Elis alleyway encounters, but I'll get that added for the next version.
