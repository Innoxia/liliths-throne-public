	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	I'm sorry that this isn't version 0.4. I'll get that out to you as another public release as soon as I possibly can.

	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar!
	If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog. ^^
