	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	This update took a week longer than I expected, mainly due to three reasons: one, the number of bugs and other minor issues which required sorting out; two, my decision to add framework for properly supporting ranged weapons; three, the amount of writing that I had to do to finish off Evelyx's Dairy content. I would have released this version to you sooner, but I really wanted to get that Evelyx content completely done before doing so, and that ended up being the last thing which I added.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, now that this version has been released, I can finally return to Elis and continue filling in content for the remaining areas in there. Unless a hotfix is required, the next release will be a preview (v0.4.2.5) that's released on my SubscribeStar (and also pushed to github if you want to build from there), in which I'll get the last few shops in the 'Wall's End' shopping precinct added. After that I'll likely move on to adding the next stage of the main quest for the public update of v0.4.3.
</p>
