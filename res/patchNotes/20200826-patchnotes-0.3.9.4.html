<h2>v0.3.9.4</h2>
<h3>Contributors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an encounter in Dominion's alleyways and Lilaya's home's corridors where you stumble upon two of your slaves having sex with one another. To trigger, you need your slaves to have the appropriate outside/house freedom and sex permissions, and the one initiating sex needs to have not had sex for at least 4 hours and to be attracted to the other. (by PoyntFury)</li>
	<li>Improved String-matching utility methods and dynamically generated ColorListPreset classes. (PR#1368 by CognitiveMist)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where sometimes multiple-partner sex would break upon orgasm. (by CognitiveMist)</li>
	<li>Added 'broodmother pill', which doubles offspring conceived during its effect. (Usage dialogue written by PoyntFury)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where having multiple arm pairs allowed an all-out strike with a 2-handed weapons. (PR#1384 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Added average penis girth in the Encyclopedia information on races. (PR#1385 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Prevented any succubus/incubus alleyway attackers from spawning with the 'Prude' trait, as it doesn't fit them. (PR#1386 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where 'Arcane impotence' was being applied when arcane was lower than 15, instead of lower than 10 as it should have been. (PR#1388 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Standardized all encounters to override getDialogues() instead of accepting Util.newHashMapOfValues() as a parameter. (PR#1389 by DSG)</li>
	<li>Added a new 'limited' option for the bypass sex action content setting, which allows you to perform sex actions of one corruption level higher than your current corruption. (PR#1391 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Added 'wet wipes' item, which cleans the target's dirty inventory slots when used. (by DSG)</li>
	<li>Added 'peach' as a silly-mode item, sold by Ralph. (Adapted from PR#339 by Rfpnj)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Engine:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added modding support for items. You can find a fully-documented example in 'res/items/innoxia/pills/fertility.xml'. Item modding will be expanded at a later date to support enchantments, but for now, the modding framework should be enough for most uses.</li>
	<li>Converted Combat from an Enum to a class, which can now be accessed via the parser using the command 'combat'.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rat Warrens:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug where Murk would always use the 'normal' dom pace instead of being rough.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug where Murk would fuck you without first taking out your pussy pump.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with missing dialogue node when having sex with Murk in the Gambling Den.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug where your sealed clothing wouldn't be displaced at the start of the Enforcer's 'strip search' sex scene.</li>

	<li>Blocked 'Offer X' and 'Request X' actions in the 'glory hole' sex position (as they didn't really work due to the position's limitations).</li>
	<li>NPCs will now only self-use an item type once in sex (so you no longer have to repeatedly use pills on an NPC who wants to use the opposite type of pill).</li>
	<li>Added an 'Automatic stripping' content option (in the 'sex' property category), which makes it so that all characters start naked in each sex scene. This is disabled by default.</li>

	<li>Updated 'Enforcer HQ' map.</li>
