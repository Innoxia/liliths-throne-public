	Hello once again,
</p>

<p>
	Sorry about how long it took me to get this update out; it should have been ready far sooner, but over the past couple of weeks I've been having some issues with lingering fatigue, which was impacting my work efficiency. Hopefully the worst of that is behind me now, and the next few updates will be released in a more timely fashion.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, for the content in this release, I've focused mainly on getting all of the unique NPCs in Elis's Farmer's Market added. Some of them will likely have their content expanded upon in the future, but hopefully they have enough to be interesting for the time being. I've also added generic bandit encounters in the Foloi Fields. These bandits have quite basic content, and unlike the random attackers in Dominion and Submission, they're not persistent, although they can be enslaved (in which case they do become persistent slaves owned by the player).
</p>

<p>
	I'm going to focus on fixing bugs, merging PRs, and getting Minotallys's content added for the next version. The next release will be a preview version, provided that there's no need for a hotfix (in which case the hotfix will be a public one). I'm hoping to have that out quite soon, and then the next full public release will be out shortly after that.
</p>
