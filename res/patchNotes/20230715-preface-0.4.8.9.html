<p>
	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	First of all, I'm so sorry for how long it's been since the last update. I've just been completely out of it due to some stressful things happening in my life recently, and while I had time in which to work on Lilith's Throne I found it very difficult to get into the right frame of mind to get much productive work done. I'll do my best to improve the release time of the next version. I really am very sorry about the delay, and I'm very thankful to all of you for your patience and support over the past couple of months.

	As for what's in this version, there are two main pieces of content, several new artworks, some new clothing and other minor changes, and a lot of bugfixes. The larger piece of content which has been added is from DSG, and involves meeting a dragon, Eisek, in the market in Elis (there's also some silly mode content for it as well). The other content is a new character, Sterope, who can be found in the Elis Enforcer station and who has some BDSM and feral (horse) sex content.
</p>

<p>
	After this release I'm going to be working on fixing and updating the wiki, as well as finally adding the main quest content which I keep on delaying. I'll also try to add some content for Silence and Shadow while I'm at it. I'll try to get that version released to you within the next few weeks, and will do my best to keep you updated on progress on my blog and SubscribeStar.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you again so much for your patience and support, and I will do my best to get back on track and put an end to these unacceptable delays.
