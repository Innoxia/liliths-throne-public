<h3>DSG's race fixes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Race version 1.3:</li>
	<li>Removed face requirements from wyvern, drake, coatl, and ryu subspecies weighting for improved support for lesser morphs.</li>
	<li>Removed attribute scaling from the Breath Weapon special attack as it was already having damage boosted in damage calculation, creating a 'double-dip'. Base damage is now fixed at 75.</li>
	<li>Removed ear requirement from coatls.</li>
	<li>Removed face TF from wyverns and drakes.</li>
	<li>Changed coatl tongue requirement to only require the BIFURCATED modifier.</li>
	<li>Improved flightlessness detection in drakes and ryus.</li>
	<li>Fixed incorrect year and formatting in the book entry for dragons.</li>
	<li>Fixed typo in bear vagina descriptions.</li>
	<li>Fixed gryphons spawning in with generic feathered wings instead of the correct wing type.</li>
	<li>Race version 1.31:</li>
	<li>Fixed three typoes in the dragon vagina TF description.</li>
	<li>Race version 1.32:</li>
	<li>Fixed similar typoes as 1.31 in the vagina TF descriptions for bears, ferrets, gryphons, otters, raccoons, sharks.</li>
	<li>Race version 1.33:</li>
	<li>Fixed formatting issue in the otter beverage effects description.</li>
	<li>Changed Breath Weapon calculation, base damage will now scale with spell damage bonuses. Starting damage is now 20. Having either a dragon torso or dragon face will increase starting damage to 50. Having both will increase starting damage to 75.</li>
	<li>Fixed feral coatls with a leg configuration of TAIL_LONG not being recognized as a coatl.</li>

	<li>Added the 'feathered' tail type to dragons</li>
	<li>Added a missing ARM_WINGS_LEATHERY tag to dragon arm-wings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added parser prefix hooks for muscle, body size, and body shape enums (using 'MUSCLE_', 'BODY_SIZE_', and 'BODY_SHAPE', respectively).</li>
	<li>Added parser prefix hook for the DayPeriod enum (using 'DAY_PERIOD_').</li>
	<li>Eye type xml files now support the 'tags' element.</li>
	<li>Added argument to foot/feet parsing commands to ignore clothing when parsed during sex.</li>
	<li>Added 'CHASTITY' item tag, which makes clothing with this tag apply the new chastity effect to characters who equip it.</li>
	<li>Added an 'applicationLength' element to status effect mods. This enables you to define how long a custom status effect will be applied for if its application conditions are found to be true. If this 'applicationLength' is missing, the currently-used default value of -1 is used, so you don't need to refactor any of your status effect mod files to account for this change.</li>
	<li>Added RESTING_LUST as an attribute, so any modded items or effects can now influence this.</li>
	<li>Changed method signature for Sex methods: 'setTimesCummedInside()' and 'incrementTimesCummedInside()'.</li>
	<li>Added 'newSexType(SexParticipantType, SexAreaInterface, SexAreaInterface)' method to the sex class (at the very bottom of the class file) so that there's a way to generate SexType objects from the parser (via the 'sex' object).</li>
	<li>You can now define 'placeLocations' in subspecies xml files to allow for subspecies to spawn in specific place types. (See 'res/mods/innoxia/race/hyena/spotted.xml' for an annotated example.)</li>
	<li>You can now actually leave 'regionLocations' and 'worldLocations' elements in subspecies xml files blank without throwing errors, as the comments said you could.</li>
	<li>Added ability to define body hair availability to the bodyPart xml files: anus, arm, face, penis, and vagina.</li>
	<li>Added ability to define subspecies names based on their leg configuration. Refactoring old subspecies xml files is not needed. If you would like to make use of this functionality, see the 'res/mods/innoxia/race/hyena/spotted.xml' file.</li>
	<li>Also added ability to define subspecies silly-mode names. See the same file as above.</li>
	<li>Added 'HAIR_NATURAL_MANE' as a body part tag for defining HairTypes as being naturally styled into a mane.</li>
	<li>Added 'slotClothing(slot, coloured)' parsing command for parsing the name of a character's clothing.</li>

	<li>Stomach bulge descriptions are now appended when the penetration length inserted into a character's vagina or anus is greater than 12.5% of their height, instead of just when penetration lengths were detected as being uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The five main horn types (curled, spiral, curved, swept-back, straight) are no longer limited to demons, and instead are generically available for all races who lack special horn types in the same way that feathered/leathery wings are.</li>
