<p>
	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	First of all, I'm so sorry about how long it's taken me to get this preview out to you. My progress was hindered due to feeling quite unwell over a period of a couple of weeks during October, and then after I'd got through that I started having some technical troubles with my computer (which still aren't fixed, but should be within a week).
</p>

<p>
	So, as for what's in this version, it's mainly the merging of third-party additions from github, as well as some other minor things. I was hoping to get some Halloween content added this year, but after all that happened over the past few weeks I wasn't able to do this. I'lldo my best to make it up to you by adding as much content as I can into the next (public) release.
</p>
