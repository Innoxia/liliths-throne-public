	<b>v0.4.0.8 Hotfix:</b> This hotfix was released primarily to fix a bug where dialogue flags would not be loaded correctly if your save had broken mods in it, resulting in many potentially game-breaking effects. <b>If your game has experienced bugs related to the resetting of knowledge about quests, the calendar, essences, etc., then I would advise you to load an older save before that happened or start a new game (sorry again for the inconvenience).</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>v0.4.0.6 Hotfix:</b> This hotfix addresses a few issues which were present in v0.4.0.5, mainly the major bug where starting a new game would fail to assign all unique NPCs to their intended home tile.
</p>
<p>
	<b>If you've started a new game in v0.4.0.5, please consider it to be irreversibly bugged and restart your game in this version.</b> Exporting your character from v0.4.0.5 and using it as an import when starting a new game in this version should work fine, so you won't have to lose your character entirely.
</p>
<p>
	I'm really sorry for this inconvenience. Also, old saves (i.e. ones which were started in a previous version and continued in v0.4.0.5) should be fine; this issue only affects newly-created games in v0.4.0.5.

	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	I'm sorry once again for how long this update has taken to get ready. When I started working on this update I felt very confident that I'd have it ready in a couple of weeks, but then I ran into the issue of needing to add support for sex managers (so that I could have more control over how sex plays out when using external dialogue files). After that, I soon needed to add support for custom sex actions being defined in external files, which, along with the manager support, unexpectedly took up a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
	After adding that sex support, I moved on to adding Meraxis content, which again proved to be more complex to implement than I expected. Adding centaur transports and content for characters in 'The Red Dragon' (a tavern in Elis) then really pushed me well past the time that I'd originally hoped to have this version released. At that point it finally looked like I was able to release this preview, and so I made the post on SubscribeStar and my blog stating that I'd have it ready by Friday 21st.
</p>

<p>
	After that, I was beset by numerous issues during testing of the content I'd added, and after having to delay the release several times I got quite down about my failure to keep to schedule. As a result of that, I ended up letting myself get sidetracked, and instead of adding the demonic centaur encounters as I'd planned, I ended up filling in all of the placeholders for the centaur transport and writing almost all of the content in The Red Dragon. The only parts which still have placeholder content are those related to Meraxis's sex scenes (which I'm planning on expanding in the next update).
</p>

<p>
	So those are basically the reasons why this release took so long to get done. I was also slower than usual in implementing the content as this was my first time really using the external dialogue framework to a significant degree. Now that I'm used to it, hopefully the next update will not take so long.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking of which, I plan on making a small update to this preview (which will be v0.4.0.6) to add the demonic centaur encounters and to fill in Meraxis's placeholders, as well as to get some more PRs merged. There are likely also some bugs which I haven't caught, so I'll get those sorted as well, whatever they may turn out to be.
</p>

<p>
	After that, I'll move on to filling out content for Elis's shopkeepers and other places around town for the public release of 0.4.1. I also plan on adding Minotallys's meeting in that update, as well as the next stage of the main quest after that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sorry once again for the slow update, and especially for the significant delay after confidently announcing that this version was to be released over a week ago. I'll make another post to keep you all updated on my progress some time early next week, so I'll see you again then!
</p>
