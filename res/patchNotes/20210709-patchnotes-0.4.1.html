<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Parsing fixes.</li>
	<li>Fixed Meraxis always referring to you as her sibling after impregnating her.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where spinneret depth wasn't being loaded properly, causing it to reload to the default depth every time you loaded a saved game.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where the game's dialogue would randomly fail to parse in some scenes, resulting in '(Error in conditional parsing!)' messages being displayed.</li>
	<li>NPCs are now only fully deleted after any pregnancies and incubations related to the player have been resolved, which should fix some issues with offspring birth dates and missing information in the pregnancy stats screen.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where deleted NPCs would cause pregnancy stats, offspring map names, pregnancy tester dialogue, and the debug offspring menu to either throw errors or display as 'Unknown' or '???'.</li>
	<li>Fixed extremely rare bug where it was still possible to impregnate a character who had 0 chance to be impregnated.</li>
	<li>Takahashi now correctly wears a lab coat while in her lab in the citadel.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where trader responses defined in external dialogue nodes wouldn't work.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue with the 'NPC.applyItemTransactionEffects()' method being called even if the transaction failed to process (such as in the case where the buying character's inventory was full).</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where selecting a disabled action (i.e. a greyed-out button) would still apply whatever effects that action had to the game.</li>
	<li>Externally defined sex managers now correctly handle all missing elements which are tagged as being 'optional'.</li>
	<li>Fixed another issue in externally defined sex managers where the 'slotsAvailable' element's 'slot' elements were not parsing code.</li>
	<li>Externally-defined dialogue nodes will now parse the 'colour' element within 'response' elements, allowing you to use conditional statements and such in them.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where characters would not get the 'frustrated' status effect after finishing sex without orgasming if they'd orgasmed within the last 24 hours.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where error log would sometimes display parsing errors when loading a game.</li>
	<li>Added missing quick sex descriptions for tongue-armpits focus.</li>
