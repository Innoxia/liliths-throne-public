	<b>Important note:</b> This update includes the following bug fix:
	<br/><i>'NPCs who have sexual histories with the player are now fully deleted when removed from the game, instead of simply being moved to the generic holding tile. This will retroactively apply when loading into this version, and should help to cut down on save file size and end turn lag.'</i>
	<br/>While I've done a lot of testing of this, there is the possibility that it might end up having unintended effects (possibly of the same severity as the game-breaking bugs in v0.4.0.5 and v0.4.0.6). Just to be safe, <b>I advise you to make a backup of your saves before loading into this version, in case this bug fix damages your save file in some way!</b> If you do encounter such an issue, please let me know about it and I'll get it fixed as a priority.

	Hello once again!
</p>

<p>
	This version was originally planned to just have Meraxis's placeholders filled out and the demonic centaur encounters added to the Foloi Fields. I ended up adding a little more than that, which is why this mini update took me a couple of weeks to get released instead of just one. Hopefully you like the additions!
</p>

<p>
	Provided that I don't need to make a hotfix, the next version will be the public one of 0.4.1, which I'm hoping to have out in a week or two from this release. Oh, and this version is '0.4.0.10' instead of '0.4.0.9' as I'd already pushed some progress to github under the version of '0.4.0.9', so I wanted to increment the version number again to help with tracking down bug reports.
