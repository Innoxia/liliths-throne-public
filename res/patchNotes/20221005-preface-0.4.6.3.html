	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	This is a hotfix release to address a couple of annoying bugs which were in v0.4.6, namely the one where slave pill permissions weren't working, the one where sex would never end when offered a pill while being immobilised, and a game-breaking one where if your elemental had the 'Aura Burn' status effect, the game could sometimes crash when ending the first turn of combat (thanks to CognitiveMist and Maxis010 for fixing that one). I also made it so NPCs can equip clothing during sex, added some vending machines to Submission, applied transformations & changes to Meraxis/Aurokaris/Ursa during Lunexis's bad end, and made some other bug fixes and minor additions.
</p>

<p>
	The release of this hotfix will now put back the release date of the preview update, which should now be expected around Friday 15th October. I'm hoping to get some Halloween-themed content added this year, so I'm aiming for the next public release to be out by the 31st.
