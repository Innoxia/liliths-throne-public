</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added encounters to the northern alleyways of Elis, all of which only trigger during night-time hours:</li>

	<li>Alleyway prostitutes - Same as Dominion alleyways.</li>
	<li>Item/clothing/weapon discoveries - Work the same way as in Dominion alleyways.</li>

	<li>Altered squirrel-morph's racial bonus from +1 health shielding to +5 physique and +10 critical damage.</li>
	<li>Youko offspring can no longer be found in Dominion's alleyways, and can instead be found in Elis's alleyways (until the Shinrin Highlands content is added, then they'll be moved there).</li>

	<li>Fixed issue where in some circumstances the player character was incorrectly being detected as being related to Lyssieth and Meraxis.</li>
