	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	While I've got all of the NPCs and maps ready for the Elis content, I haven't managed to get most of the scenes and dialogue added. Due to this, I've temporarily restricted world map travel for this version, and will re-enable it in 0.4.1 once I've got the content added.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry that the Elis content isn't ready yet - adding the additional internal Elis maps and writing the scenes for all of the places really took far longer than I expected. I'll get 0.4.1 out to you as soon as I possible can!
</p>
