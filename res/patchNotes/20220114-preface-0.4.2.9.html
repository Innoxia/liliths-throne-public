	<b>NOTE FOR THIS VERSION:</b> If you're loading in from a pre-v0.4.2.5 save into this version, then the loading time might take a little longer than usual as the old save format needs to be converted into a new offspring save format. After a long load, it might be a good idea to make a new save right away, to avoid this delay next time the game is loaded.

	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	I've called this version 0.4.2.9 instead of 0.4.3 as I still have a few pieces of placeholder dialogue left to fill in for Penelope's spa, and I've also not had time in which to thoroughly test this version, so it's likely that there will be an additional update near the start of next week to fix any issues that arise.
</p>
