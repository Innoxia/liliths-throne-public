<h2>v0.4.1.5</h2>

<h3>Contributors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added Felicia (Arthur's neighbour) as a unique character who can be met after completing the first stage of the main quest (more content for her will be added later). (by Rick Docket and DSG)</li>
	<li>Added Samoyed-morph subspecies to the dog-morph race. (by DSG)</li>
	<li>Added a new fetish preference menu to the options menu, which allows you to set values for influencing the fetishes and desires random NPCs will be generated with. (PR#1553 by Maxis)</li>
	<li>Prevented patch notes from being run through the parsing engine, which was occasionally causing null pointer exceptions. (PR#1567 by Stadler76)</li>
	<li>Removed the hasSexCountWith() method and replaced all of its uses with the getTotalTimesHadSex() method to fix issues with inconsistencies in dialogues. (PR#1568 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Added a new setting for outfit files which makes it possible to apply an outfit to an entire region (i.e. collection of world types). (PR#1569 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Created a new character class for slaves which can be bought in Slaver Alley, thereby fixing an issue where slaves generated while the player was not in Dominion/Submission would be of unexpected race types. (PR#1570 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Removed unnecessary copy when accessing the unique item count of an inventory, greatly reducing inventory lag and load on the garbage collector. (PR#1573 by AtelierAmber)</li>
	<li>NPCs will no longer perform orgasm reactions or denials in response to the player orgasming when the player is hidden. (PR#1578 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>If a corruptive action is bypassed by fetish, the pink '!' icon will now be recoloured to grey to signify that no corruption will be gained. (PR#1583 by CognitiveMist)</li>
	<li>When the player does not have enough flames to use 'Buy (All)', but has enough to buy at least one item, the game will now offer 'Buy (Max NN)' in the 'Buy (All)' slot, where NN is the amount that will be purchased. (PR#1584 by CognitiveMist)</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where characters that the player had never met were getting added to the contact list when loading a game. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed soft lock with the fields bandit encounter where if the bandit was willing to rape but not attracted to the player, no dialogue options would be given to continue the scene. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed an rare stack overflow error when loading a saved game in which the player had slaves or followers. (PR#1590 by Jtecx and CognitiveMist)</li>
