	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	This version is mainly focused on fixing bugs and adding some other minor features, such as tail ovipositor support and importing characters in the nightclub. There were so many bugs to fix that I didn't manage to get started on merging pull requests from github or adding the third party content I was looking at, but that will be the focus of the next preview version.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Please note:</b> You can transfer your saved games, exported characters, saved enchantments, and transformation presets from previous versions into new versions simply by copying the contents of your 'data' folder into the new version's 'data' folder!
