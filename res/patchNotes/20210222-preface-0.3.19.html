	Hello again!
</p>

<p>
	<i>This version of 0.3.19 is a small hotfix to address some bugs which were present in 0.3.18!</i>
</p>

<p>
	For this preview update, I've got Nyan's reworked romance content finished up to the point where you can go on a restaurant date with her every weekend.
	While I do still plan on adding marriage content for her, I'm going to leave that until much later, as I really need to focus on adding Fields and main quest content for at least the next several full versions.
</p>

<p>
	I've also added a few other features which have been requested a lot: importing characters as guests; setting slaves free; and improving the gym's workout effects.
	There are also once again numerous additions and fixes from contributors in this version, including the spider-morph race by Charisma, many bug fixes by AceXP and Stadler76, and updates to DSG's races.
</p>

<p>
	The next version will definitely be the full public release of 0.4, which will include Fields and main quest content.
	I'm hoping to have that out in about a week, but please be prepared for it to potentially take two weeks instead (as the content may take me a little while to get added).
</p>
