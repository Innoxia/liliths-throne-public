<h3>Contributors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed issue where Enforcer patrols wouldn't spawn correctly. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where non-human coverings wouldn't appear as recolouring options in Helena's slave creator. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed minor parsing issue with Enforcer Patrol description during arcane storms. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where a background error would something be thrown in sex, softlocking the scene. This was being encountered most frequently in Frysia's sex scene. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where arachnid leg descriptions had a parsing error in them. (by Stadler76)</li>
	<li>Added feature where if an offspring's father and/or mother has generic wings (feathered, leathery or insect) or horns (curled, curved, straight, etc.), the offspring can inherit them. (PR#1370 by Stadler76)</li>
	<li>Suppressed descriptions of nipples as orifices and transformation options for nipple penetration when that content was turned off in user settings. (PR#1421 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Added 'Elasticity depth effects' mechanic: If an orifice's elasticity is at least 'limber', its maximum uncomfortable depth is increased, with greater elasticity values increasing it further. This is off by default, but can be turned on in content settings. (PR#1413 by LightCanadian)</li>
	<li>Modified UtilText.java to properly handle a few inaccurate British to American translations. (PR#1447 by TadUnlikely)</li>

	<li>Prevented strap-ons from being equipped when there is one already equipped (in another slot). Also fixed issue where covering colour for an equipped dildo was potentially being incorrectly referenced. (PR#1453 by AceXP)</li>

	<li>Made Enforcer disguises more difficult to pull off and added flavour text for when impersonating (or failing to impersonate) specific Enforcers. (PR#1501 by DSG) </li>
	<li>Fixed bug where if the game was installed in any folder with 'res' in the name, then viewing book entries for external/modded races in the encyclopedia would throw errors. (by Stadler & AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where place tiles were not being populated with regional subspecies in the world map. (by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed some issues with hard-coded values for NPC spawning in the Bat Caverns, allowing spiders to spawn down there too. (PR#1514 by Stadler)</li>

<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>

	<li>Added 'genericType' fields for Wing and Horn xml files, so that you can define those types as being generic (not associated with any parent race) or not.</li>
	<li>Fixed spelling error of 'DISBALE_' instead of 'DISABLE_' in SubspeciesFlag values (I added a catch for this in the code so even if your mod has the incorrect spelling it won't break).</li>

	<li>Added 'CORRUPTION_LEVEL_' prefix as a parsing hook to the CorruptionLevel enum.</li>
	<li>Added a few methods to the game class  to give you hooks to some useful UtilText methods: parseFromFile(); addSpecialParsingString(); and clearSpecialParsingStrings().</li>

	<li>Added support for defining DialogueNodes and Encounters as external xml files, which, like the maps, will (soon - hopefully in 0.4.1) allow for scene modding.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Zaranix is now still called 'Zaranix' when in his feminine form, instead of 'Zoelix' (as the name change wasn't being mentioned anywhere or referenced at all, and didn't make much sense).</li>
	<li>Tidied up Zaranix's post-combat dialogue and added variations for if non-con is turned off, as well as for the player to request Zaranix to transform into succubus form after swallowing his TF potion.</li>
	<li>Made it so that Zaranix's oral sex scenes now start with you already sucking his cock, instead of having to wait for him to deal with clothing displacements first.</li>

	<li>Added functionality to sort saved games by date or alphabetically.</li>
