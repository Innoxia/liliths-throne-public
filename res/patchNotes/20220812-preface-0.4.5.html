	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	For this public release I've filled in the placeholders in the Themiscyra main quest content, added some minor things, and fixed a few bugs. The next release will be back to a preview (v0.4.5.5), and I'm hoping to have it released in a couple of weeks from this release.

<p>
	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar! If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog.
