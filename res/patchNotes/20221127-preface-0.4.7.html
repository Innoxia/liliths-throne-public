	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	For this release, I ended up focusing on merging more pull requests from github, fixing bugs, and getting some other minor things sorted out. I feel as though the game should be in quite a stable state after this release, so for the next updates I'll be focusing more on adding content instead of making minor changes.
</p>

	<b>Please note:</b> You can transfer your saved games, exported characters, saved enchantments, and transformation presets from previous versions into new versions simply by copying the contents of your 'data' folder into the new version's 'data' folder!
</p>

<p>
	Thank you all for playing Lilith's Throne, and a very big thank you to all of you who support development by reporting bugs, making PRs, or backing me on SubscribeStar! If you wanted to ask me any specific questions about the game, you can either find me on my blog, or on the Lilith's Throne Discord. You can find a link to the discord on my blog.
