</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added two new Enforcer characters and a new quest involving them, all of which has been designed by DSG. The start of this quest will randomly trigger in Dominion's street tiles under the following conditions: no arcane storm; main quest is past Brax's section; over 5 days have passed since completing the 'Angry Harpies' quest; time is 17:00-21:00.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Items:</h3>

	<li>'Biojuice Canisters' and 'Glowing Mushrooms' are now tagged as restricted items.</li>

	<li>Items and weapons will now correctly display ItemTag descriptions in their tooltips.</li>
