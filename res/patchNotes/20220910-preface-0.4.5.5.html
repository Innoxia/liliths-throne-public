	Hello again!
</p>
<p>
	Sorry about how long this version was delayed for; I ended up running into some issues with getting the content added for the Amazons' camp (mainly struggling to get the writing done), which is what caused most of this delay. Anyway, I've finally managed to get it finished, and I'm going to slightly change how I work on things for future updates, which should hopefully prevent a delay like this from occurring again.
</p>

	As for what's in this release, there's new Nyan art from a new artist, Davyn (https://twitter.com/davyndraw), the aforementioned content for the Amazon camp, a new deer race, bug fixes, and a few other minor things. There is an alternate bad end route planned for Lunexis's content in the Amazons' camp, but I didn't quite have time to get the writing for it finished off, so I'll get that done for the next version.
