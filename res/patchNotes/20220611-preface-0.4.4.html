	First of all, I'm sorry about how long it's been since the last release. I've been going through some bad times recently, and progress on LT has unfortunately suffered as a result of this. While not back to 100%, I'm feeling a lot better now, so hopefully the next update will be out in a more timely fashion.

	As to what's in this version, the main things are the complete addition of Oglix's content (in the tavern in the northern alleyways of Elis), as well as the addition of expanded content for repeatedly submitting to randomly-generated alleyway attackers in Dominion, Submission, and Elis. There's also some content which triggers while wearing the 'rental mommy' or 'rental daddy' t-shirts.
