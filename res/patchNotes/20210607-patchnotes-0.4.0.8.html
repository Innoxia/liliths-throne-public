<h2>v0.4.0.8</h2>

<h3>Contributors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where dialogue flags would not be loaded correctly under certain conditions, resulting in many potentially game-breaking effects. (by AceXP) Innoxia's note: If your game has experienced bugs related to the resetting of knowledge about quests, the calendar, essences, etc., then I would advise you to load an older save before that happened or start a new game (sorry for the inconvenience). </li>
	<li>Added functionality to debug menu to show the chances of encountering various races in the current location - added in the 'Misc.' tab, 2nd page as 'Spawn rates' action. (PR#1531 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Added a special attack, 'talon slash', to characters that have taloned feet (i.e. harpies). The base damage is 20 (same as a kerambit). If the attack does damage, extra damage is applied as a critical effect. (PR#1530 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Made some optimisations to the GameCharacter.getChildren() and GameCharacter.getNonCommonNodes() methods to decrease save times by around 33%. This change is most noticeable on games with a large number of offspring. (PR#1533 by Sarkath)</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where the key for locked clothing that was unequipped during sex was being removed from the unequipper's keys, even though the item was automatically re-equipped after sex resulting in the unequipper not having the key. (PR#1541 by debouchere)</li>
	<li>Fixed a huge amount of typos and consistency errors in dialogue. Full patch notes for this PR are at the bottom of these patch notes. (PR#1550 by AceXP)</li>
	<li>Fixed a NullReferenceException which was being thrown whenever a slave laying incubated eggs hadn't previously birthed live young. (PR#1551 by Maxis010)</li>
	<li>Fixed some parser bugs and improved HLFQuest UX by adding button to search for password and improving firebomb quest descriptions and triggers. (PR#1547 by DSG)</li>
	<li>Refactored all of the existing 'Self' type sex actions from 'Player/Partner' into shared actions. (PR#1539 by Maxis010)</li>
	<li>Added more detailed rabbit-morph lore. (by Manwhore)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Sadistic sex actions are now only available to characters who have the 'sadist' fetish.</li>
	<li>Set 'slap ass' as a sadistic action, and added 'spank ass' as an alternative that's available to characters who don't have the sadist fetish.</li>
	<li>Added tongue-armpit sex actions (i.e. licking armpits), which are available in any position that allows tongue-breast interactions. (Armpit content can be disabled in the content options.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Renamed the actions for entering Elis to 'Enter (main)' and 'Enter (rear)'.</li>
	<li>The 'aristocrat' occupation is now recognised by Leotie as being a suitable occupation at the start of her test.</li>
	<li>Added 'eggs implanted' and 'eggs incubated' as tattoo counter types.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Typo and parsing fixes.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where Loppy's artwork wasn't being displayed.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where over 24 hours would sometimes pass when using Astrapi's centaur ride for the first time, and also fixed a related bug where Vronti's journeys would always pass over 24 hours.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where tattoo cum counts would not increment for slaves who were having sex with generic characters. (e.g. When they were having sex in the brothel or in the stocks or with other slaves.)</li>
	<li>The 'Forced chastity (desperate)' status effect will no longer be reset to 'Forced chastity (calm)' after every save/load.</li>
</ul>
