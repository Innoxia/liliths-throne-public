<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Made some slight improvements to the documentation of the xml files related to race modding.</li>

	<li>Added comments for the imageName elements in 'res/mods/innoxia/items/items/race/hyena_bone_crunchers.xml'.</li>
	<li>Choosing to not define any covering modifiers or patterns in coveringType mods is now correctly handled without throwing background errors.</li>
	<li>Leaving the 'backgroundName' element empty or not including it in subspecies xml mod files is now correctly handled and uses the default race background (as was implied it should in the comments).</li>
	<li>Added elements in the 'racialBody.xml' file for defining male and female hip sizes ('maleHipSize' and 'femaleHipSize').</li>
	<li>Added parsing hook to BodyPartTag (using the prefix 'BODY_PART_TAG_').</li>
	<li>Added ColourTags, which can be added to modded colours to have them be automatically added to the game's covering colour lists.</li>
	<li>Added setCovering() to Body class to make the setting of coverings easier in race mods. (See 'applySubspeciesChanges' element in lion.xml for an example on this being used.)</li>
	<li>You can now leave the half-demon name elements empty in subspecies xml files (in which case the game will automatically generate a generic half-demon name for your subspecies).</li>
	<li>Added support for a 'displaySize' attribute to the 'iconName' element in subspecies xml files, allowing you to define the resizing percentage of your icon image.</li>
	<li>Added 'coveringIconColour' element for modded colours, allowing you to define the colour to use a different colour for covering icons than its usual colour for text.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>

	<li>If a character has the cat-morph's 'panther face', their cat-morph body parts will be converted into panther-morph parts when loading into this version.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>

	<li>Fixed issue where declining sex in a nightclub partner's apartment would lead into the nightclub's toilets dialogue instead of Dominion boulevard dialogue.</li>
	<li>The game no longer autosaves when following or taking a nightclub partner home, as loading the autosave which was generated at that point would result in that NPC being unintentionally deleted. Instead the autosave is generated after leaving the partner.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where nightclub partners would not be saved if you followed them home and then refused sex, despite the tooltip indicating otherwise.</li>

	<li>Removed incorrect reference to going to consulting Lilaya when having eggs implanted inside of you, and replaced it with a hint on having to access your phone's menu in order to lay them.</li>
	<li>Enchanting the item 'Biojuice Canister' now correctly gives you just the option to create a slime-reversion elixir, instead of the full racial options that other standard racial TF items have access to.</li>
	<li>Fixed image position and alignment in combat move tooltips.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where milking pumps and spider webbing seals could spawn as generic clothing on randomly-generated NPCs.</li>

</ul>
