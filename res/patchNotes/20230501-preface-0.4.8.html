	Hello again,
</p>
<p>
	I'm sorry once again for how long it's taken me to get this version released. I've been having quite a bad time since December, with both stress and bouts of low mood making it very difficult to focus on writing lewd content for LT. I'll do my very best to get back on track as soon as I can, and will try to get the next release out to you in a more reasonable time frame.
</p>

<p>
	I've managed to get some new content added for this version, although I've had to cut the main quest content that I was working on as I wasn't able to finish it in time. There's also new art for five characters in this version. FriendlyAlienFriend (https://twitter.com/thealienfriend) has created art for Meraxis's three demon lieutenants; Fyrsia, Hyorlyss, and Jhortrax. Pusspuss (https://twitter.com/PusspussARTZ) has created art for both Shadow and Silence, who will be getting content within the next couple of versions.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you all once again for your patience and support during this period of slow releases. I really will do my very best to get the next versions released within a few weeks of one another.
</p>
