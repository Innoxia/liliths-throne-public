	<b>NOTE FOR THIS VERSION:</b> If you're loading in from a pre-v0.4.2.5 save into this version, then the loading time might take a little longer than usual as the old save format needs to be converted into a new offspring save format. After a long load, it might be a good idea to make a new save right away, to avoid this delay next time the game is loaded.

	Hello again,
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately I didn't manage to get as much done as I'd hoped for this version, and so the only significant content addition is the new encounters in the alleyways of Elis. I'll try to get another public release out as soon as I can to add 'The Crossed Blades' tavern and main quest content.
