<ul>
	<li>Affection gains for overworked slaves have been reduced.</li>

</ul>

	<li>When transforming a character's leg configuration into 'quadrupedal', 'arachnid', or 'avian' from any of the other configurations, that character will gain 33% extra height (the 33% increase is reverted when transforming the other way).</li>
</ul>
