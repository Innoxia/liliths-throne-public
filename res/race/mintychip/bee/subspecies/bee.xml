	The 'displaySize' attribute defines how much (if any) this icon should be shrunk to fit onto the background image.
		This is so that you can make your icon a full-sized svg, so that it's a full size for use in other places (such as for the book image or item backgrounds) and resize it just for this subspecies icon.
		The default value I use is 80 (corresponding to 80% of the image's full size), but you can define it however you like, or even omit it entirely (in which case a value of 100 is used).
		A setting of 100 means that no resizing will be made to your icon image. -->
