	<!-- The id of the race which this nipple belongs to.

	<!-- The id of the material covering this nipple.
	This should always be left as 'NIPPLES'.

	<!-- The descriptors which should be drawn upon when describing a masculine character's nipple of this type.
	Additional nipple descriptors are generated based on the nipple's properties (such as its modifiers, lubrication, capacity, etc.), so these descriptors should only be related to the race itself. -->
	<descriptorsMasculine/>
	<!-- Same as above, but for feminine characters. -->
	<descriptorsFeminine/>
	<!-- Hyena nipples do not need any racial descriptors, but if you wanted to add some, use this format:
	<descriptorsMasculine>
		<descriptor><![CDATA[hyena-like]]></descriptor>
	</descriptorsMasculine>

	<!-- The orifice modifiers which this nipple has when first created (such as when a new hyena-morph is spawned).
