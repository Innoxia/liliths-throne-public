	<!-- Whether or not this vagina type can have pubic hair growing around it.
	As a character's pubic hair is shared between their penis and vagina, I've taken the decision to give penis type priority in determining whether or not pubic hair is allowed (as the penis is above the vagina, it seemed logical to do it that way).
		As such, if a character's vagina type does not allow pubic hair, but their penis type does, then they can grow pubic hair.
		Conversely, if a character's vagina type does allow pubic hair, but their penis type does not, then they cannot grow pubic hair.
		As an aside, a character lacking both penis and vagina cannot grow pubic hair.
	By default, vagina types allow pubic hair if its race is of either the MAMMAL or BIRD RacialClass. As such, this vagina type would allow pubic hair even if this element was omitted (as salamanders are of the MAMMAL class), but I've included it here for demonstration purposes.
	You should define this as either 'true' or 'false', or, if you'd like to leave it to its default value, then leave this element blank or omit it entirely. -->

	<!-- Whether this vagina type lays eggs (true) or gives birth to live young (false). -->
	<eggLayer>true</eggLayer>
	
	<!-- The singular/plural names of this vagina.
	One of the defined names will be chosen at random every time the name is displayed to the player. 
	Names ending in '-' are handled in a special manner by appending a random, generic vagina name to the end of it before returning, so for this example of 'salamander-', the names 'salamander-pussy', 'salamander-twat', etc. will be returned. -->
