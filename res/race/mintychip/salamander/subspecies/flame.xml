		Hyenas cannot transform to gain a serpent-tail lower body, so this really has no effect whatsoever, but if your subspecies is something like a snake, you'll want to set this to a reasonable value.
		Values are defined as a percentage of the character's 'size', with this percentage being added onto their size to generate their total length.
		As most of a snake's length is in fact their body, not their tail, the usual value for this element is a lot lower than you might expect, and is by default 0.1 (which represents 10%).
		For an example of how this works, if this salamander was to somehow become a serpent-tailed feral, they would have a body length of 85 (as defined above in the 'size' element) plus an additional 10% of that from their tail length as defined here.
