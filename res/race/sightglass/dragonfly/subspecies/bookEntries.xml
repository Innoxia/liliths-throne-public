		Dragonfly-morphs are commonly most comfortable near freshwater.  Most common along the river running through the Foloi Fields, they may also be found in the wilderness near isolated ponds, or in cities. Massive eyes, a double-pair of membranous wings, and a exceptionally long, narrow abdomen is usually enough to identify a person as a dragonfly-morph.

		Dragonfly-morphs are uniquely agile in flight, and have keen reflexes and spatial awareness to track their surroundings with their large bulbous eyes. Many have a competitive side, enjoying high-speed chaotic sports and sparring. Some have a repution for being rather impatient and arrogant towards who "can't keep up" in some way or another.

		As in many other aerial species, arcane storms are especially powerful for exposed dragonfly-morphs. Many will gather in large mid-air orgies, aggressively posturing and competing. During a arcane storm, a dragonfly-morph will latch onto their chosen partner with the claspers at the tip of their tails, and will remain attached for hours, even in flight.

		Like most morphs, a dragonfly-morphs's offspring will be a mix of dragonflies and the partner's race. Dragonfly-morphs generally lay clutches of eggs.
