		Beaver-morphs are almost exclusively found near waterways in temperate fields and forests surrounding Dominion. In Dominion itself, they prefer riverfront areas to live and work. Rounded ears, large blunt snouts with gnawing chisels of teeth, and their distinctive broad, flat tail are usually enough to identify a person as a beaver-morph.

	<p>
		While the individual personalities of beaver-morphs vary greatly from one individual to another, they have a reputation for being extremely hard-working and meticulous, yet exceptionally polite and friendly. With an affinity for construction, love of water, and flawless teamwork, many put their excellent work ethic to use constructing and maintaining waterways and the ships that travel along them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like most other races, beaver-morphs get affected by arcane storms. Even while overwhelmed with lust, they are considerate and gentle, easily charming even the most frenzied beast-morph for some good mutual fun.
	</p>
	<p>
		A beaver-morph's offspring will be a mixture of beaver-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
