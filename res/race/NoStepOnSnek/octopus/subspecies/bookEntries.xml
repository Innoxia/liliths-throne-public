		Octopus-morphs are almost exclusively found in the larger bodies of water Lilith's Realm, although the odd individual may sometimes wash up around the canals of Dominion. Their distinctively octopus-like lower half is usually enough to identify a person as an octopus-morph.

	<p>
		While the individual personalities of octopus-morphs vary greatly from one individual to another, they have a reputation for being both curious and highly intelligent.
	</p>
	<p>
		All octopus-morphs have the lower body of an octopus, meaning that in place of legs, they have eight prehensile tentacles. This aquatic form of theirs makes them very reluctant to stray far from water, and so octopus-morphs are almost never encountered in any inland location.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like most other races, octopus-morphs get affected by arcane storms. However, due to the fact that most of them live far away from Dominion's epicentre of such storms, they typically only experience mild effects.

	<p>
		An octopus-morph's offspring will be a mixture of octopus-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
