		While the individual personalities of snake-morphs vary greatly from one individual to another, they have a reputation for being quite clingy. This is most likely due to the fact that their anatomy is a bizarre mix between cold and warm-blooded, and so just like their feral counterparts, they enjoy cuddling up to the hot bodies of others.

		While the common term 'snake-morph' refers to bipedal variants of this race, they are very much a small minority of the total snake population, as the vast majority of this race are found in the form of lamia. Slithering around on their long, snake-like lower bodies, this common subspecies is not well adapted to city or town life, and so are most regularly seen out in the countryside. A lamia which also has wings is referred to as a 'melusine'.

		Like most other races, snake-morphs get affected by arcane storms. Being exposed to arcane thunder will make snake-boys seek out a partner to mate with, while snake-girls will go into heat.
	</p>
	<p>
		A snake-morph's offspring will be a mixture of snake-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
