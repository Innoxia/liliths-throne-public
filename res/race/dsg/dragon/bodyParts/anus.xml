	This should always be left as 'ANUS', but I've included the option to change it here in case you wanted to experiment.

	<!-- You can do as I've done here and leave this empty to use the game's default names for an anus ('asshole', 'backdoor', and 'rear entrance'), or define your own anus names like so:
	<names>
		<name><![CDATA[asshole]]></name>
		<name><![CDATA[back door]]></name>
		<name><![CDATA[rear entrance]]></name>

	<!-- The descriptors which should be drawn upon when describing a masculine character's anus of this type.
	Additional anus descriptors are generated based on the anus's properties (such as its modifiers, lubrication, capacity, etc.), so these descriptors should only be related to the race itself. -->

	<!-- Same as above, but for feminine characters. -->

	<!-- Hyena anuses do not need any racial descriptors, but if you wanted to add some, use this format:

	<!-- The orifice modifiers which this anus has when first created (such as when a new hyena-morph is spawned).
