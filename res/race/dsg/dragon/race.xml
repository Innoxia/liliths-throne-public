	<!-- Any special changes which should be applied to a newly-spawned character of this race.
	This is applied *before* individual Subspecies' 'applySubspeciesChanges' method.
	The character's body that's being changed can be accessed via using 'targetedBody'.
	The code here is redundant, as clitoris girth is set to 4 in the racialBody.xml file, and modified in the spotted and striped subspecies files, but I've added it in here to show a working example. -->
