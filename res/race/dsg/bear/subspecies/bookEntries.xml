		Bear-morphs can be found throughout the Realm's cold and temperate regions as well as the cities within those regions. Their large size, powerful claws, and short tails distinguish then among other morphs. A notable subspecies found mostly in the Shinrin Highlands is the panda-morph, who are usually smaller in size and have a distinct black-and-white pelt.

		Although individual bear-morphs differ from one another, they are generally wary of strangers and reluctant to even smile at someone they are unfamiliar with. To outsiders they may seem to be a grim and dour race, but among family and friends they can be warm and easygoing. In the winter months, bear-morphs do not hibernate but do become more sleepy. It is not uncommon to find bear-morphs asleep during mealtimes or napping on park benches during this time.

		Unlike their more widespread cousins, the panda-morph is considerably less standoffish. They may be considered harder to provoke and easier to befriend. Living in the relatively consistent climate of the Shinrin Highlands has gradually removed their need for hibernation, and many choose to descend to lower-lying areas to escape colder weather.

		Like most other races, bear-morphs get affected by arcane storms. How strongly they are affected depends on their proximity to the storm with the most strongly affected becoming extremely territorial.

		A bear-morph's offspring will be a mixture of bear-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
