		Although individual bear-morphs differ from one another, they are generally wary of strangers and reluctant to even smile at someone they are unfamiliar with. To outsiders they may seem to be a grim and dour race, but among family and friends they can be warm and easygoing. In the winter months, bear-morphs do not hibernate but do become more sleepy. It is not uncommon to find bear-morphs asleep during mealtimes or napping on park benches during this time.

	<p>
		Like most other races, bear-morphs get affected by arcane storms. How strongly they are affected depends on their proximity to the storm with the most strongly affected becoming extremely territorial.

		A bear-morph's offspring will be a mixture of bear-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
