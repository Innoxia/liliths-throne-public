		There are few places in the realm where a gryphon-morph's wings will not carry them, but they mostly prefer places where the environment makes flight easy. As such, even though they are not a numerous race, it's possible to find them gliding from perch to perch in the Mountains of the Moon or riding thermals above the open country of the savannah and the Foloi Fields. A gryphon-morph's unusual, half-leonine-half-avian physiology makes them stand out from other morphs.

		While gryphon-morphs differ from one another individually, they are generally regarded as a kind, if stuffy bunch overly concerned with an obscure code of chivalry. Their kindness does not always stem from concern for others, however, even if it is genuine. Some gryphon-morphs believe themselves to be better than others, and are motivated to help out of a sense of pity for their lessers. As a flight-capable race, many gryphon-morphs find employment as couriers, sometimes in competition against their fully-avian brethren.

		Like most other mythological races, gryphon-morphs are more affected by arcane storms than others. Exposed to arcane lightning up close, a gryphon-morph will gain an irresistible urge to subdue a mate, sometimes in mid-air, and abduct them back to their homes.

		A gryphon-morph's offspring will be a mixture of gryphon-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
