		Ferrets prefer the temperate climate and open country of the Foloi Fields but also inhabit the more heavily wooded areas to its east as well as Elis. Some may even venture as far as the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon or Dominion. Their pointed snouts, long bodies, and penchant for physical flexibility make them distinct from other morphs.

	<p>
		Although not all ferret-morphs are the same, they are stereotyped as being curious and playful sometimes to a fault. A confined ferret-morph deprived of entertainment will quickly become bored and desperate for any sort of stimulation. Extended confinement may even begin to wear on their mental faculties. The ferret's signature combat move is the War Dance, yet this zig-zagging maneuver does not always indicate hostility. Towards someone they are familiar with, it can serve as a friendly greeting.

	<p>
		Like most other races, ferret-morphs are affected by arcane storms. Ferret-girls must be especially careful as being exposed to arcane lightning up close will put them into heat. If this heat is not resolved, they will eventually become sick.

	<p>
		A ferret-morph's offspring will be a mixture of ferret-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
