		While all raccoon-morphs differ from one another individually, they have a reputation as adaptable scavengers. Their sensitive paws can discern by touch what average eyes fail to discern by sight. It is generally not recommended to try swindling a raccoon-morph with counterfeit goods and consequently many raccoon-morphs make their living in fields where either knowing how to spot fakes or how to producing convincing ones are vital skills.
