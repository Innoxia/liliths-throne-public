		While all raccoon-morphs differ from one another individually, they have a reputation as adaptable scavengers. Their sensitive paws can discern by touch what average eyes fail to discern by sight. It is generally not recommended to try swindling a raccoon-morph with counterfeit goods and consequently many raccoon-morphs make their living in fields where either knowing how to spot fakes or how to produce convincing ones are vital skills.

		Like most other races, raccoon-morphs are affected by arcane storms and experience heightened libidos. Unlike other races, however, raccoons that have been exposed to arcane lightning up close salivate uncontrollably which tends to form a sort of foam around their mouths, and their hands become sensitive erogenous zones.

		A raccoon-morph's offspring will be a mixture of raccoon-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
