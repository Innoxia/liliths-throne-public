		Shark-morphs are not common outside the vast waters of the Endless Sea. Those that do leave their traditional home generally choose areas with high humidity or easy access to water since like most aquatics they find dry conditions uncomfortable. Possessing distinct, finned tails and toothy grins, shark-morphs are difficult to mistake for other fish.

		Stereotyped as bloodthirsty and aggressive, shark-morphs are usually very straightforward about what they want in everything from fighting to business to sex, and only reluctantly give up their pursuits. 
		 Although some find this transparency refreshing, many are intimidated by it and as a result try to stay away from shark-morphs.
		 In anthropomorphic form, shark morphs are varied in appearance. Some have visible ears and dorsal fins while others don't, and some even lack the sandpaper-like skin that their feral forms universally possess.

	<p>
		Shark-morphs, like other mortal races, are affected by arcane storms although most live away from Dominion and only experience mild effects.
		 Being exposed to arcane thunder up close will put both shark-boys and shark-girls into breeding frenzies. It is therefore no surprise that enclaves of shark-morphs living closer to Dominion see a surge in their numbers after every storm.

		A shark-morph's offspring will be a mixture of shark-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
