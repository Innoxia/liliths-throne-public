		Otter-morphs prefer, but do not require, easy access to water and are thus mostly found along the coastal areas of the Endless Sea and the banks of the Hubur River although some may wander into Elis, the Foloi Fields, or Dominion. In riverine areas especially it is not uncommon for otters to set up transport or bridge-laying services. Rounded, low drag ears, long flexible bodies, and rudder-like tails distinguish them from other morphs.

		While the individual personalities of hyena-morphs vary greatly from one individual to another, otter-morphs are stereotyped as eternally playful and unable to take anything seriously even while defending themselves. Although often genuine, this playfulness is sometimes a form of deception intended to get a an opponent to lower their guard or a stranger to reveal their true nature. Many a ne'er-do-well has attempted to victimize a seemingly oblivious otter-morph only to end up on the receiving end of a mighty tail slap.

		Like most other races, otter-morphs are affected by arcane storms. When exposed to arcane lightning up close, they become uncharacteristically aggressive and will force themselves on others. Caution should be exercised around river crossings and ferries run by otter-morphs during these storms.

		An otter-morph's offspring will be a mixture of otter-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
