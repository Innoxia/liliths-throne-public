		Raptor-morphs are anthropomorphic birds of prey, and as such this race includes several distinct subspecies such as falcons, eagles, and owls. One or more types of raptor-morph can be found in every area of Lilith's Realm, although they're a far less common sight than harpies. A strong, feathered body, along with sharp talons and piercing eyes, are usually enough to identify someone as a raptor-morph.

		Although each raptor-morph will have their own unique personality and preferences, especially between different subspecies, they have a widespread reputation for being independently-minded and mostly indifferent to the affairs and troubles of others. They are also known for their willingness to administer vigilante justice upon those who have wronged them, which they are more than capable of doing thanks to their strong, agile bodies, with their ability to fly being very useful to rapidly chase down and then escape from their opponents.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most raptor-morphs choose to live in large treehouses outside of large settlements, and those who are unable or unwilling to do so prefer to reside in the tallest apartment buildings which they can afford. Most raptor-morphs' treehouse homes are located in the Foloi Forests, from which they commute to Dominion, Elis, or other small settlements.

	<p>
		Raptor-morphs, like the other common races, get heavily affected by arcane storms. Being exposed to arcane thunder will make both raptor-boys and raptor-girls aggressively seek out a partner with whom to forcefully mate.
	</p>
	<p>
		A raptor-morph's offspring will be a mixture of raptor-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
