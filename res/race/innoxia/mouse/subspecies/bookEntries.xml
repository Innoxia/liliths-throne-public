		Mouse-morphs are one of the more populous races within Lilith's Realm, and while they can be found almost anywhere, the vast majority of them make their home in the Foloi Fields. A spry, furry body, with a long, thin tail and a pair of rounded ears is usually enough to identify someone as a mouse-morph.

	<p>
		Although they're treated much like any other morph within the cities throughout Lilith's Realm, within the Foloi Fields mouse-morphs have a particular reputation as being kind, honest, and hard-working. There are of course many exceptions to this rule, but it's more likely than not that a mouse-morph will choose to selflessly offer their help to those in need within their local community.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the farms throughout the Foloi Fields are owned and run by a large variety of races, mouse-morphs make up a large portion of arable farmers. Their reputation has been earned from the enthusiasm and cheerful nature they display each year during harvest time. Large families of mouse-morphs will all work together to harvest their fields of wheat, corn, and barley, after which they'll travel to their neighbouring farms and help out wherever they can.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mouse-morphs, like the other common races, get heavily affected by arcane storms. Being exposed to arcane thunder will make mouse-boys seek out a partner to mate with, while mouse-girls will go into heat.
	</p>
	<p>
		A mouse-morph's offspring will be a mixture of mouse-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
