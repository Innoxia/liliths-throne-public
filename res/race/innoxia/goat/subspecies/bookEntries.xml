		Goat-morphs can be found all over Lilith's Realm, although they're most commonly found working on one of the many farms in the Foloi Fields. A tough, furry body, with the possibility of having horns, is usually enough to identify someone as a goat-morph.

		While the personality of a goat-morph is likely to vary wildly between individuals, they have a propensity for being strong-headed and rebellious. If someone is able to overcome this and become friends with a goat-morph, they're sure to have a solid friendship, for goat-morphs are known for forming close bonds with those who they trust.

	<p>
		Along with cow, horse, and sheep-morphs, goat-morphs form the core of the workforce in most of the farms found scattered throughout the Foloi Fields. While not as prized as that of cow-morphs, goat-morphs are able to sell their milk, which is often turned into a strong cheese.

		The elder lilin, Lovienne, is known for having a particular fondness for half-demon goat-morphs, which are referred to as baphomets. Due to this association with an elder lilin, goat-morphs are sometimes erroneously assumed to have strong connections to demons, although in truth they're no more likely to have demonic connections than any other race.
	</p>
	<p>
		Goat-morphs, like the other common races, get heavily affected by arcane storms. Being exposed to arcane thunder will make goat-boys seek out a partner to mate with, while goat-girls will go into heat.
	</p>
	<p>
		A goat-morph's offspring will be a mixture of goat-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
