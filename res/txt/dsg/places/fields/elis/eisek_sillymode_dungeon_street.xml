		You detect a faint odour emanating from a nearby building. It is unpleasant but also familiar. Upon closer inspection, the smell is coming from the building's basement, the door to which is down a short flight of stairs. This must be where that group of dragon-obsessed weirdos do their "LARP"ing or at least gather in numbers.
