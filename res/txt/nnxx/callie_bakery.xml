			Situated on the intersection of the road and a nearby alleyway stands what appears at first to be a plain looking boutique, but upon closer inspection it bears several signs of being in a state of disrepair. Pausing to take note of the peeling paintwork and the door's rusty hinges, you wonder what kind of owner would care so little for their business. Glancing through the nearest window, which is cracked and adjacent to one that's been completely broken and boarded up, you see a bored-looking horse-girl wearily polishing her nails behind the store's counter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Above the door shyly stands an old wooden sign with 'The Creamy Bakey' written on it in the most simple way possible. Resting against the window beside the front door is a sign which indicates that the shop is open from

			Situated on the intersection of the road and a nearby alleyway stands Callie's bakery. Far from how it was the first time you saw it, this once-shabby establishment now looks like a proper shop. In place of the old wooden one, a hand-crafted oak sign has been  painted in candy pink to proudly bear the name 'The Creamy Bakey'. The door frame has been replaced and sculpted to look like candy cane, while the door itself has been painted so as to look like it's made of marzipan. Through the clean new windows, you can see that the interior has been completely refurbished; new tables and chairs offer comfortable places for the establishment's modest client√®le to sit and eat, while the bakery's glass counter holds a variety of bakery and sweets.

		Deciding to pay a visit to 'The Creamy Bakey', you push open the shop's front door and [pc.step] inside. Looking around, you see that the interior is decorated with fake candies and baked goods of every sort. On the counter before you stands a scented candle giving off an aroma of vanilla which tenderly mixes with the scent of a dozen doughnuts that are displayed behind the counter's glass top. Sitting right next to this candle is a tip jar which looks to be as empty as the shop itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		[callie.speech(Hello and welcome to 'The Creamy Bakey',)] the horse-girl behind the counter calls out as she sees you enter, before scoffing, [callie.speech(I'm Callie, the owner of this shop, and as you can see, this place is bustling with people so be careful not to get lost in the crowd.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, the horse-girl turns her attention back to her nail polishing, allowing you to pause and take a good look at her. Although mostly human in appearance, you can see that Callie has a pair of horse-ears and a horse-tail, which are as pitch-black as her long, wavy hair. The dark-red, short-sleeved shirt which she's wearing has had its top few buttons left undone, granting you a plunging view of her light-skinned, [callie.cupSize]-cup bust. As the counter is partially open on the bottom, you're able to see that she's wearing a pair of simple, off-white jeans, and after moving your gaze up from her pair of horse-like hoofs, you see that there's quite the bulge in her crotch. Noticing that you haven't left after her introduction, the horse-girl looks at you once again, before sighing, [callie.speech(Sorry about that; I tend to become sarcastic when I'm bored. So what will it be champ, want a doughnut? That's all I have to be honest.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly feeling a little self-conscious about the fact that her bakery only sells doughnuts, Callie doesn't wait for you to respond and quickly goes on to explain, [callie.speech(I barely make any money at all from this dump, and so I only have enough to make doughnuts. That's what sells the best out of what I've tried. So, do you want to try one...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Callie allows her question to trail off in a manner to suggest that she's asking for your name. Picking up on the hint, you give the horse-girl your name, after which she repeats her question by asking, [callie.speech(So, do you want to buy a doughnut, [pc.name]?)]

		 With a big smirk on her face, Callie steps over to the store's front door, before locking it and flipping the sign to show that her establishment is closed. After dropping the blinds to give you some privacy, Callie returns to stand beside her counter, before pulling down her jeans and revealing both her huge horse-cock and puffy asshole. Teasing her fingers over her rapidly-hardening, ebony shaft, she commands with a moan, [callie.speech(~Mmm!~ Go on then, bend over the counter and show me your ass.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Doing as you're told, you bend down over the counter in front of Callie, presenting her with your [pc.ass+]. Immediately, the horny horse-girl steps forwards and presses the flared head of her animalistic cock up against your [pc.asshole+]. Playfully rubbing her throbbing dick up and down over your hungry hole, she teases, [callie.speech(We're not stopping until I'm satisfied... Now go on, beg for it...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Failing to suppress a horny squeal, you push your [pc.hips+] back and desperately beg for Callie to start fucking your ass. Half-way through your frantic plea, the horse-girl suddenly gives you what you want, and you find yourself moaning in ecstasy as Callie thrusts forwards and sinks her fat, hot horse-cock into your asshole, before starting to buck her hips and fuck you over her counter...

				Having second thoughts about this, you tell Callie that you've changed your mind about getting stuffed with her baguette.
			#ELSE
				Finding the asking price of ten thousand flames to be too steep, you tell Callie that you've changed your mind about paying to get stuffed with her baguette.
			#ENDIF
			 Upon hearing this, the horse-girl lets out a disappointed huff and sighs, [callie.speech(Aww, that's a pity... I was already starting to get all hot and bothered from the idea of turning you into my personal cock-sleeve... I guess it will have to wait.)]
		#ELSE
			As Callie isn't attracted to you, there's no way that you're going to be able to have sex with her. Letting out a disappointed sigh, you wonder what to do next...

		Having had her fun, and with her fat horse-cock starting to soften, Callie steps back and sighs, [callie.speech(I think you've had enough for today...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As the horse-girl pulls up her jeans, you let out a deep sigh and prepare to get your things back in order...

	<p>
		As you quickly get your things back in order, Callie moves over to pull up the blinds and unlock the front door. Turning to face you after performing this task, she smiles and states, [callie.speech(You're good at taking horse-cock...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As the horse-girl then walks over to return to her side of the counter,
		#IF(pc.getClothingInSlot(IS_NECK)!=null && pc.getClothingInSlot(IS_NECK).getClothingType().getId().equals('innoxia_neck_filly_choker'))
			 you point to the choker around your neck, before telling Callie that you've been well trained as one of Natalya's fillies, and that getting fucked by big horse-cocks is one of your favourite parts of the job.
		#ELSE
			 you tell Callie that it was easy to satisfy her thanks to how perfect her big, throbbing horse-cock is.
		#ENDIF
		 Smiling as she hears you say this, the horse-girl offers, [callie.speech(Well, seeing as you love it so much, you can come back and get stuffed by my baguette again tomorrow... Now, is there anything else I can get you today? A doughnut, perhaps?)]

	<p>
		Although Callie's bakery is quite small, there's still enough room in this seating area to hold several tables and chairs. There's nobody making use of them, however, as all of the customers you've seen so far choose to order their doughnuts as takeouts.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's really not much for you to do here except turn around and head back over to Callie's counter...
