	<!-- HUMANS -->

	<htmlContent tag="HUMAN_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Humans are the least numerous of all the races. Although some people appear to be human on first glance, a fluffy pair of ears, a swishing tail, or a concealed bestial cock will often end up betraying their status as a morph of one race or another. Humans have wildly varying personalities, body types, and sexual preferences.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="HUMAN_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Demons, following the orders of the Lilin, often encourage other races to treat humans as inferior beings. Rumours of Lilith's intense dislike of humans are commonplace, which would explain the fact that humans are banned from serving in any position of power within Dominion. This is partially the reason why humans are so rare; those that are born human often transform themselves to avoid persecution.
	</p>
	<p>
		A defining feature of humans is that they are typically unable to harness the arcane, which often leads to further ridicule from the other races.
	</p>
	<p>
		Human offspring will be a mixture of more humans and offspring of their partner's race.

	<!-- ANGELS -->

	<htmlContent tag="ANGEL_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Just like demons, angels conform to their traditional appearance. Their bodies closely resemble that of a human's, while a gigantic pair of white-feathered wings grow from their backs. Their skin, while similar to that of a human's, gives off a pale golden radiance at all times.

	<!-- ELDER LILIN -->

	<htmlContent tag="ELDER_LILIN_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The seven elder lilin are, as their name would suggest, the oldest of all Lilith's offspring. While there are many lilin in the world, only these seven are Lilith's natural-born daughters. All of the other lilin were corrupted by Lilith into their new forms.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order of seniority, the seven elder lilin are: Lirecea, Lovienne, Lasielle, Lyssieth, Lunette, Lyxias, and Lisophia.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="ELDER_LILIN_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The elder lilin are almost as powerful as Lilith herself, and each one has complete mastery of the arcane. Just like all of the other lilin, they can transform their bodies to take on the appearance of any race imaginable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Along with Lilith, all seven of the elder lilin were sealed away inside the mirror dimension for thousands of years, where they helped their mother to weave her reality-changing spell. After being released, Lovienne and Lasielle took the posts of Lilith's personal guard, while Lirecea, Lunette, Lyxias, and Lisophia were placed in charge of the four regions surrounding Dominion. Due to her reluctance to punish the archangel given to her, Lyssieth was suspected of harbouring treasonous thoughts, and was placed under house arrest in her subterranean palace.
	</p>
	<p>
		A lilin's offspring depends on what race their partner is. Copulation with other lilin results in the birth of more lilin, while mating with a demon produces demon offspring. If crossed with a half-demon or non-demon, the resulting offspring will be half-demons of their partners race. Finally, a lilin being bred with imps will produce more imps, although such a thing would be absolutely unthinkable in demon society.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<!-- LILIN -->

	<htmlContent tag="LILIN_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		All lilin were once common races who were corrupted by Lilith into extremely powerful demonic entities. Either by being particularly exceptional in their abilities, or by merit of their position in society, the lilin were chosen by Lilith to be her adopted offspring, and now serve their mother without question.
	</p>
	<p>
		Along with Lilith herself, only the elder lilin are more powerful than the lilin, with even the strongest of demons proving to be no match for their mastery of the arcane. Around half of the lilin population choose to remain in their demonic form, with the other half making good use of their ability to transform any way they like in order to take on the form of anthro-morphs or mythological creatures.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="LILIN_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The number of lilin in the world is estimated to be less than a thousand, with the vast majority of them being the daughters of Lilith who were created before she was banished to the mirror dimension. Disguised as humans, they coordinate with their demonic daughters to subvert and infiltrate world governments and the media, thereby keeping the planet's population ignorant to the fact that Lilith is working towards world domination.
	</p>
	<p>
		A lilin's offspring depends on what race their partner is. Copulation with other lilin results in the birth of more lilin, while mating with a demon produces demon offspring. If crossed with a half-demon or non-demon, the resulting offspring will be half-demons of their partners race. Finally, a lilin being bred with imps will produce more imps, although such a thing would be absolutely unthinkable in demon society.

	<!-- DEMONS -->

	<htmlContent tag="DEMON_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Not only are demons real, but the vast majority of them also conform to their stereotypical image, sporting a pair of horns, bat-like wings, and a spaded tail. They can also transform their bodies into any other demonic form they like, allowing them to both remove their external demonic parts, as well as to recolour their skin, allowing them to appear to be human. Very few of them would ever choose to do this, however, as while demons are at the top of the social hierarchy, humans are at the very bottom.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="DEMON_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Demons are created in one of two ways. They are either born from a lilin or demon copulating with another demon, or they are created when a lilin corrupts someone into becoming a demon.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite their stereotypical appearance, demons do not have the traditional predisposition towards being evil. In fact, the only trait that sets them apart from any other race is that they're far more inclined to be willing to have sex with pretty much anyone or anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		All demons have incredibly strong arcane auras, which are not only able to shield them from an arcane storm's effects, but also allow them to readily harness powerful arcane spells. Thanks to this, demons find it very easy to gain employment and make money, as, thanks to telekinesis, fluid manipulation, energy generation, or many other arcane abilities, they can complete almost any manual-labour job in a fraction of the time it would take a regular worker to perform.
	</p>
	<p>
		A demon's offspring depends on what race their partner is. Copulation with a lilin or another demon produces demon offspring. If crossed with a half-demon or non-demon, the resulting offspring will be half-demons of their partners race. Finally, a demon being bred with imps will produce more imps, although such a thing would be considered taboo in demon society.
	</p>

	<!-- HALF-DEMONS -->

	<htmlContent tag="HALF_DEMON_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Half-demons come in two main varieties; human half-demons, and non-human half-demons. Both types of half-demon are looked down upon in demon society, but are still considered to be of more importance than any non-demonic race.
	</p>
	<p>
		Non-human half-demons can transform their face and torso from human to animal-morph and back, but all other non-demonic parts of their bodies are immutable as animal-morph parts. Demonic eyes, horns, and sometimes wings are clear indications that a particularly savage-looking morph is a half-demon. Human half-demons have slightly more limited transformation abilities, and, while still being able to transform the size of all body parts, their only racial transformation ability consists of removing or altering their horns, wings, and tail.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="HALF_DEMON_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Non-human half-demons are particularly wild and animalistic at times, and, depending on their race, can exhibit extremely unpredictable behaviour, ranging from extreme aggression to intense sexual desire. Due to this, they struggle to fit in to Dominion society, and can instead be found out in the wilder regions of the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike their wild counterparts, human half-demons are very calm and civil, but it's not their behaviour that's the cause of demonic resentment, but their bodies. Lilith's hatred of humans is well known, and so for a demon or lilin to have copulated with one is somewhat of a minor taboo. More serious than this, however, is that human half-demons are the origin of the despised race of crude, uncivilised, sex-obsessed imps. Human half-demons who breed with either a non-demon or another human half-demon will produce a brood of imps, and as such, many human half-demons are extremely reluctant to get pregnant. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A half-demon's offspring depends on what race their partner is. A non-human half-demon will always produce more of their half-demon race, with the only exceptions of always producing human half-demons if partnered with a human half-demon, and producing imps if bred with an imp. A human half-demon, on the other hand, will produce more human half-demons when coupled with a lilin, demon, or half-demon, and imps with any other race.

	<!-- IMPS -->

	<htmlContent tag="IMP_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Other than their diminutive height (with most individuals standing at around [units.size(92)] tall), an imp's appearance is identical to that of a demon.
		 Despite their similar appearances, however, imps are far more mischievous and aggressive than their larger counterparts.
		 Due to these antisocial personality traits, Dominion's Enforcers always drive imps out of the city at first sight, with the vast majority of them ending up down in the undercity of Submission.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="IMP_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Just like demons, imps are immune to all racial transformations, and, while they're still affected by non-racial transformation potions, they lack the demon's ability to shape-shift their own bodies at will.
		 Again, in similarity to demons, there's no way to transform someone into an imp through use of standard potions.
		 The only way that an imp is created is by being the offspring of the resulting pregnancy between a demon and a non-Lilin.
	</p>
	<p>
		Individually, imps are very weak, and so for their own protection (as well as for the increased opportunity to cause mischief), they will naturally form gangs of up to five or six members.
		 The leader of these gangs is typically the largest one of the group, and is referred to as the alpha imp.
		 Although most of the time these gangs are content to fight amongst themselves, they occasionally work up the courage to assault larger races.
		 There have even been cases of imps sneaking up out of Submission during an arcane storm; making the most of the lack of Enforcers to assault anyone in sight.
	</p>
	<p>
		An imp's offspring will always be more imps.

	<!-- COW-MORPHS -->

	<htmlContent tag="COW_MORPH_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Although cow-morphs can often be found in Dominion, they're far more common and numerous out in the Foloi Fields, where their primary occupation is working in the many farms that litter the landscape.
		 The females of this race, called cow-girls, tend to be quite docile and submissive, which is in stark contrast to their male counterparts (cow-boys), who are typically very dominant and territorial.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="COW_MORPH_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Cow-girls are well known for having gigantic breasts and heavy lactation, and, due to this, are often the target of unwanted attention.
		 It's commonplace for a cow-girl to have her breasts regularly milked, and the Foloi Fields are littered with milking sheds suited for this purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cow-girls have strong herding instincts, and will naturally seek out a cow-boy to submit to.
		 As a result of this, harems are a common part of cow-morph society, with some of the stronger and more dominant cow-boys leading herds of up to fifty females.
		 Cow-boys are usually the owners of the many farms out in the Foloi Fields, and will assign their herd to be responsible for tending to their crops, as well as for providing milk for the farm's dairy.
	</p>
	<p>
		A cow-morph's offspring will be a mixture of more cow-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.

	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="DOG_MORPH_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Dog-morphs are typically highly excitable and incredibly sociable, which often causes them to approach strangers in an attempt to make new friends.
		 Although such friendly behaviour is common, dog-morphs still have varied personalities, much like humans, and not all of them are as gregarious as their reputation would have you expect.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dog-morphs, like the other common races, get heavily affected by arcane storms.
		 Being exposed to arcane thunder will fill dog-boys with the desire to assert their dominance over anyone they meet, while dog-girls will go into heat.

	<htmlContent tag="WOLF_MORPH_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Unlike dog-morphs, wolf-morphs are extremely unpredictable, and although they sometimes share the same energetic mannerisms as dog-morphs, they often focus their energy on trying to assert their dominance.
		 Wolf-morphs typically have short tempers and a primal instinct to prey on the weak.
		 As a result, many people try to avoid encounters with wolf-morphs, finding them to be more trouble than they're worth.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fox-morphs are a common anthropomorphic race, spread through both Dominion and the Foloi Fields. The fennec-fox-morph subspecies is primarily found in the more arid regions to the south of Dominion, while the arctic-fox-morph subspecies is found almost exclusively in the aptly-named 'Snowstorm valley'. No matter their subspecies, fox-morphs have a tendency to be very cunning and mischievous, and often love nothing more than playing practical jokes on others.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="FOX_MORPH_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Due to their love for trickery, fox-morphs are believed to be insensitive to the feelings of others, but they see their own behaviour as little more than a harmless prank. Despite this, there's little trust ever placed in the fox-morphs of Dominion. Often enough, some of them move out of the city, so they can live freely, and there exists some places in the nearby forests which are inhabited almost entirely by fox-morphs and related races.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fox-morphs, like the other common races, get heavily affected by arcane storms.
		 Their mischief then takes on a noticeably more sexual bend, as they then try to have their way with others, sometimes forgoing all pretense of trickery in favor of force.

	<htmlContent tag="FOX_ASCENDANT_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Youkos are a subspecies of fox-morph, characterised by possessing one or more arcane-imbued fox-tails.
		 These special tails grant them a very strong affinity with the arcane, which, depending on the youko in question, is harnessed either for good causes or to play tricks on others.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="FOX_ASCENDANT_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Youkos can acquire extra tails (up to a maximum of nine) by having them granted either by a nine-tailed youko, or directly from the patron lilin herself.
		 Their tails directly correspond to their ability with harnessing the arcane.
	</p>
	<p>
		The youko race is mainly divided between two philosophies; the worship of their patron lilin as being a benevolent goddess, or as one of deceit and sadistic trickery.
		 While they may differ in philosophies, all youko are particularly adept at casting illusion-based spells.
	</p>
	<p>
		Youko almost never leave their traditional forest home of the Shinrin highlands, and for any traveller choosing to venture in there, meeting a youko can be either a wonderful blessing or a terrible curse.
		 While benevolent youko will offer food, shelter, and other aid to strangers, the malevolent youko will trick and waylay anyone unfortunate enough to encounter them.
		 These tricks which the malevolent youko love to play on people can be incredibly sadistic in nature, and thanks to their illusionary spells, they've been known to trap and relentlessly torment travellers in their forest territory for years on end.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is incredibly rare for a malicious youko to choose to breed with other races, as they instead prefer to inflict orgasm-denial on their defeated foes.
		 A youko's offspring will be a mixture of youko and offspring of their partner's race.

		Horse-morphs are one of the more common anthropomorphic races found in this world. A pair of horse-like ears and a swishing tail are usually enough to identify a horse-morph. If a horse-morph grows a pair of feathered wings, they will be defined as a 'pegasus-morph'. A single horn growing out of their forehead marks them as a 'unicorn-morph', while having both wings and horn is enough to define someone as an 'alicorn-morph'.

	<p>
		Centaurs in this reality are defined in exactly the same way as those from Greek mythology; by having the lower body of a feral horse. While they can be of any race, the upper bodies of the vast majority of centaurs in the wild are human in nature. Any wings grown by a centaur will appear on their horse's body, defining them as a 'pegataur'. A single horn growing out of their forehead marks them as a 'unitaur', while having both wings and horn is enough to define someone as an 'alitaur'.

	<p>
		Centaurs, as well as the less-common pegataurs, unitaurs, and alitaurs, are almost exclusively found in the farmland surrounding Dominion, known as the 'Foloi Fields'. While they typically do their best to be law-abiding citizens, they possess a very wild temperament, and it doesn't take much to provoke one into displaying their more primal instincts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Possessing the lower body of a feral horse, centaurs are capable of great feats of strength, and as such they are highly sought-after by the arcane-impotent farmer population for manual labour. While happy enough to perform tasks such as ploughing fields or carrying farmyard equipment, being used as transport (with someone riding their back) is considered to be a sign of either extreme intimacy or utmost subservience. Only doting couples or centaur-slaves are ever involved in such a demeaning practice.

		Bat-morphs mostly keep to themselves, and, being nocturnal, they sleep in their caverns during the day and only come out at night.
		 Thanks to their echolocation ability, which involves emitting ultrasonic squeaks to produce echoes, they can 'see' perfectly in pitch-black darkness.
		 Bat-morphs are typically quite reclusive and shy, but, much like humans, their personalities vary considerably between individuals.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bat-morphs, like the other common races, get heavily affected by arcane storms.
		 Being exposed to arcane thunder will make bat-boys enter a potent rut, while bat-girls will go into an intense heat; seeking to be bred by the first suitable partner that they can find.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bat-morphs will give birth to one or two offspring at once.
		 Their pregnancies work in exactly the same way as a normal human one.

	<p>
		Rabbit-morphs are one of the most common races to be found in the Foloi Fields, and are also occasionally to be seen wandering the streets of Dominion.
		 Their large rabbit-like ears and round, fluffy tails are usually enough to identify someone as a rabbit-morph.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="RABBIT_MORPH_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The vast majority of rabbit-morphs are obsessed with breeding and being bred.
		 Although their personalities can vary wildly between individuals, they all share the same primal instinct to produce as many offspring as possible.

	<htmlContent tag="ALLIGATOR_MORPH_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Alligator-morphs are one of the rarer races of this world.
		 They're almost exclusively found in the watery undercity of Submission, making them one of the rarer races to be seen walking the streets of Dominion, in spite of their significant population.
		 Their large reptilian tails and alligator-like snouts make alligator-morphs very easy to identify.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="ALLIGATOR_MORPH_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Alligator-morphs are usually quite laid-back and easy-going, and prefer to live down in Submission to get away from the busy hustle-and-bustle of Dominion's streets.
		 They also love swimming, and are responsible for having converted huge parts of Submission's tunnels into slow-flowing waterways.
		 Being very similar in looks to the hyper-aggressive crocodile-morphs found in other parts of the world, alligator-morphs have, very unfairly, gained a slight reputation for being aggressive trouble-makers.
		 In contrast to how most of the population see them, alligator-morph's personalities vary greatly between individuals, and are no more or less aggressive than any of the common morphs that roam Dominion's streets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alligator-morphs, like all non-demonic races, get heavily affected by arcane storms.
		 Being exposed to arcane thunder will make alligator-morphs enter a potent mating frenzy, which, when combined with their great strength, makes them a dangerous foe to encounter during an arcane storm.
		 This is yet another reason for their self-imposed exile to Submission, as they're able to escape the effects of arcane storms down there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alligator-morph pregnancies are a mix between mammalian and reptilian reproduction.
		 They are impregnated in much the same way as a human, but instead of giving birth to live young, a clutch of eggs will grow inside an alligator-girl's womb once she's been fertilised.
		 Pregnancy advances just like that of other common races, but when it comes time to give birth, the alligator-girl will seek out a safe place to lay her eggs.
		 After incubating her clutch for approximately eighteen to twenty-four hours, the alligator-morph's young will hatch, with the resulting offspring being a mixture of alligator-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.

	<!-- SLIMES -->

	<htmlContent tag="SLIME_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Slimes are one of the rarer races of this world. The vast majority of their population resides in the watery undercity of Submission, but they can also be found in small numbers all over the world. Slimes are very easy to identify, as their entire body is made out of gooey slime, with a glowing core in the place where their heart should be. In place of skin, they have a soft, hydrophobic membrane, allowing them to safely enter water or other bodies of liquid without dissolving. It also prevents any unwanted sperm from entering their bodies and impregnating them.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="SLIME_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Just like most races, the personality of slimes differs greatly from individual to individual, with the vast majority being pleasant, law-abiding citizens. There are a minority, however, who believe that their diet should consist solely of sexual fluids, and these troublemakers have shown no hesitation in attacking innocent travellers to milk for their next meal...
	</p>
	<p>
		Slimes survive entirely on a liquid diet, transforming any fluid that they ingest (or extract out of absorbed solids) into more slime. Just like any other liquid, their slimy bodies evaporate over time, requiring them to maintain a regular fluid intake.
	</p>
	<p>
		Slimes, like all non-demonic races, get heavily affected by arcane storms. Being exposed to arcane thunder will make slimes desperately seek out someone to milk for fluids. Upon finding and subduing a suitable target, slimes will continuously milk their victim until their hunger is well satisfied.
	</p>
	<p>
		Slime pregnancies work in a very different manner to all others. Regardless of whether a slime looks feminine or masculine, or whether they have transformed to give themselves a vagina or not, all slimes can be impregnated. If any cum reaches their core, new cores may later split off, before growing inside them for the same length of time as a regular pregnancy. When fully grown, the parent slime will split into multiple new slimes, with each of the new cores moving into a new slime body.

	<!-- HARPIES -->

	<htmlContent tag="HARPY_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Harpies have human bodies and faces, but in place of arms, they have huge, feathered wings.
		 Their legs are similarly bird-like in appearance, and are covered in leathery, bird-like skin, with talons in place of feet.
		 In stark contrast to most mythological tales, harpies are exceptionally beautiful, and their feathers come in all sorts of brightly coloured varieties.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>

	<htmlContent tag="HARPY_ADVANCED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Although harpies live in Dominion, they're almost never seen walking down at street level.
		 Instead, most of the buildings in Dominion have had their roofs converted into 'harpy nests'.
		 These nests are large communal living spaces, where harpies in the same flock will live together.
		 Each nest will be controlled by the most attractive harpy in the flock, who is commonly referred to as the flock's matriarch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Harpy society is both matriarchal and very insular, and can seem quite alarming to an outside observer.
		 All harpy society is based on femininity and beauty, and the more attractive a harpy is, the higher they are on the social ladder.
		 Any harpies that are not part of a flock will be mercilessly bullied and taunted by members of other flocks until they submit to the protection of a matriarch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each matriarch will have their own way for a harpy to show submission, but some of the more common demands involve public humiliation, or having to offer themselves as sexual relief for the rest of the flock.
		 Once the matriarch decides that their display of submission has been acceptable, the harpy will be accepted into the flock,
			 although they will often continue to be treated as a servant or slave by any harpies that are more attractive than they are.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most harpies, no matter if they're male or female, are gynephilic, with the odd exception being ambiphilic.
		 Due to this fact, male harpies do their best to look as feminine as possible, in order to appear attractive to the harpy females.
		 Despite their best efforts, however, male harpies are never as feminine as the females, which causes them to be treated as the lowest of the low, and will be mercilessly bullied by all females in the flock.
		 Harpy males seem to think that this arrangement is worthwhile, as if they do a good job of obeying their mistress's commands, they will sometimes be offered sex as a reward.
	</p>
	<p>
		All harpies, both male and female, have a well-deserved reputation for being narcissists, and are only interested in being more attractive than the other harpies in their flock.
		 They will take extreme offence at being called ugly, and can quickly be driven into a blind rage by anyone doing so.
	</p>
	<p>
		Harpy pregnancies are a mix between mammalian and avian reproduction.
		 They are impregnated in much the same way as a human, but instead of giving birth to live young, a clutch of eggs will grow inside a harpy's womb once she's been fertilised.
		 Pregnancy advances just like that of other common races, but when it comes time to give birth, the harpy will seek out a safe place to lay her eggs.
		 After laying is complete, the mother becomes fiercely protective of her clutch, and will refuse to sleep while she incubates her eggs for approximately eighteen to twenty-four hours.
		 Once the eggs finally hatch, the mother will usually collapse from exhaustion.
		 The resulting offspring will be a mixture of harpies and offspring of their partner's race.

	<!-- ELEMENTALS -->

	<htmlContent tag="ELEMENTAL_FIRE_BASIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		From summoning forth shards of ice, to lifting objects by means of telekinetic powers, there are many different and varied ways in which the arcane can be harnessed.
		 Of all the spells that are commonly known, however, none are as difficult or as draining to cast as those that summon forth elementals.
	</p>
	<p>
		By binding their arcane aura to one spell school or another, a highly-proficient arcane user can create an elemental seemingly out of thin-air.
		 These elementals may appear to have a will of their own, but, while it is true that they are capable of taking independent action, it has been proven by arcane researchers that they are being controlled by their summoner's subconsciousness.
		 That is to say, they are not generally regarded as living creatures in their own right, but simply a physical manifestation of the summoner's arcane aura.
	</p>
	<p>
		As only the most powerful of demons are able to cast these summoning spells, there haven't been many detailed studies conducted into the nature of elementals.
		 What has been discovered, however, is that no matter which school an elemental is bound to, or how many times it is summoned and dispelled, the elemental is always the same core being, and will always identify itself by the same name.
		 It is also a fact that, much like demons, the vast majority of elementals choose to take the form of a female.

		Fire elementals, much as their name would suggest, are experts in all matters related to arcane fire.
		 They typically take the form of a female demon, made entirely of blazing orange or blue flames, save for a little obsidian core where their heart should be.
		 Although they look hot enough to burn anyone foolish enough to come too close, the arcane flames that make up a Fire elemental's body are no hotter than a normal person's body temperature, allowing them to be touched just like any other elemental.

	<p>
		Able to cast a wide range of Fire spells, and using their fiery bodies to launch devastating attacks, an elemental bound to this form seems to enjoy combat more than anything else.
		 They typically act in a very unpredictable and excitable manner, and at times, seem to be entirely out of the control of their summoner.
