			In stark contrast to Dominion's bustling, ever-busy streets, the city's back alleys are all but completely deserted. Most likely due to their deserved reputation as being the dangerous home to muggers and rapists, you find that most of your time travelling through these twisting, labyrinthine passageways is spent in complete isolation. As you turn the next corner, however, your solitary journey is interrupted, as up ahead you see [npc.a_fullRace(true)] leaning back against one of the alley's walls.

		[pc.speech(One's already been set aside for [npc.name],)] you reply, [pc.speech(I was going to let [npc.herHim] have the guest room that you prepared for me before, remember?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[rose.speech(Of course,)] Rose replies, shutting the front door as you and [npc.name] move forwards into the grand entrance hall. The cat-girl maid then turns to address your [npc.relation(pc)], [rose.speech(Welcome to the household, [npc.name]. If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to use the pull-cord in your room to summon me. Now, if the two of you will excuse me, I'll inform Mistress Lilaya of your arrival.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Curtsying once more, Rose turns and hurries off back to the lab. Taking hold of [npc.namePos] [npc.hand], you then set off into the mansion, leading [npc.herHim] to [npc.her] new room...

		It doesn't take long for you and your [npc.relation(pc)] to arrive at [npc.her] new room, and after you've opened the door and lead [npc.her] inside, you turn to [npc.name] and say, [pc.speech(This is your room now, so please make yourself feel at home. You've got an en suite bathroom over there, and if you put your dirty clothes in the laundry basket, they'll be cleaned for you for the next day. You can leave all of your worries behind, now that you're living here with me.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Dropping [npc.her] suitcase to the floor, your [npc.relation(pc)] once again launches [npc.herself] at you, and as [npc.she] pulls you into a big hug, [npc.she] exclaims, [npc.speech(I love you, [pc.mom]! Thank you so much! I-I can't believe this is really happening!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I love you too,)] you respond, returning your [npc.relation(pc)]'s hug as you share this precious moment with [npc.herHim].
	</p>
	<p>
		After a moment, [npc.name] pulls back, before planting a kiss on your cheek and saying, [npc.speech(This is honestly the best thing that's ever happened to me... I can never thank you enough! I'll keep on looking for a job, and once I've got one, I'll start paying rent. I'll repay you for all of this, I promise!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling [npc.name] to take it easy, and to spend some time getting used to [npc.her] new room, you step over to the door and prepare to take your leave. Before you depart, however, your [npc.relation(pc)] once again thanks you for your kindness, and tells you that [npc.she] is eternally grateful to you for not abandoning [npc.herHim] to a life of crime.
	</p>
	<p>
		Promising [npc.herHim] that you'll be back later to check up on [npc.herHim], you step out of [npc.namePos] room and wonder what to do next...
