		As you lift the collar up to [npc.namePos] neck, you see that the ring attached to the front starts to glow green; a clear indication that it's detecting your [npc.daughter] as a potential enslavement target. Encouraged by the light, you finish what you started, and with a heavy metal 'clink', you clasp the collar around [npc.namePos] neck.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the collar's arcane enchantment recognises its new wearer as being a criminal, ominous purple lettering starts to glow around the metal band, which reads:
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'>
		[style.italicsArcane(Slave Registered.
			<br/>Identification: [npc.nameFull(true)]
			<br/>Race: [npc.Race])]
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(npc.isMute())
			Finally realising what's going on, [npc.name] looks up at you with fear in [npc.her] [npc.eyes] and lets out an almost inaudible whine.
		#ELSE
			Finally realising what's going on, [npc.name] looks up at you with fear in [npc.her] [npc.eyes] and exclaims in shock, [npc.speech(Wait, [npc.pcName]! This isn't a slave collar is it?!)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Grinning at your [npc.daughter], you don't have time to offer a response, as with a bright purple flash, [npc.she] suddenly disappears from sight. The last thing you see as [npc.sheIs] whisked away is a face of shocked betrayal, and you can only imagine how angry [npc.she]'ll be when you see [npc.herHim] next.
	</p>
	<p>
		From Finch's instructions, you know that <b>[npc.sheHas] been teleported to the 'Slave Administration' building in Slaver Alley</b>, where [npc.she]'ll be waiting for you to pick [npc.herHim] up.

		As you bring the [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] closer to [npc.name], you feel [#SPECIAL_PARSE_1] start to steadily hum; a clear indication that your [npc.daughter] is being detected as a potential enslavement target. Encouraged by this, you decide to finish what you started, and quickly force [npc.name] to wear the enslaving clothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the arcane enchantment recognises its new wearer as being a criminal, ominous purple lettering is projected into the air, which reads:

		Holding the [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] in one [pc.hand], you take a step towards [npc.name]. [npc.She] lets out a sigh as [npc.she] sees what you're about to do, and says, [npc.speech(If you're trying to enslave me, it won't work... I'm already a slave...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Ignoring [npc.her] warning, you force the item of clothing onto [npc.name], before stepping back and waiting to see if anything happens. True to [npc.her] words, however, the [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0]'s arcane enchantment recognises [npc.name] as already being a slave, which is evidenced by glowing green lettering that's projected into the air, reading:

		Holding the [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] in one [pc.hand], you take a step towards [npc.name]. [npc.She] lets out a distressed cry as [npc.she] sees what you're about to do, but [npc.sheIs] so exhausted that [npc.she] can't manage to put up any significant amount of resistance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Forcing the item of clothing onto [npc.herHim], you step back, looking down at a face filled with fear. Despite the fact that [npc.sheIs] a wanted criminal, the [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0]'s arcane enchantment recognises the fact that you don't have a slaver license, which is evidenced by glowing red lettering that's projected into the air, reading:
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'>
		[style.italicsBad(Invalid owner! Slaver license required!<br/>
		Please contact the nearest Enforcer and inform them that this target is a wanted criminal!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[npc.Name] lets out a relieved sigh as [npc.she] sees that [npc.sheHas] avoided being enslaved. Not wanting to waste your time trying to hunt down an Enforcer who could deal with this [npc.race], you make a disappointed tutting noise as you step back and wonder what to do next...
