			Although the area of the bat caverns in which you find yourself appears to be deserted, you suddenly hear the unmistakable sound of someone shuffling about coming from somewhere up ahead.

		</p>

			Seeing that [npc.sheIs] focusing on a patch of glowing mushrooms, you quickly assume that [npc.sheIs] some kind of mycologist, and must be foraging for edible, or more likely psychedelic, mushrooms.
			#IF(npc.isConfident())
				 As [npc.she] notices your approach, the [npc.race] looks over at you, and in a confident tone, confirms your suspicions, [npc.speech(Hey there, just me a moment to gather this! I've gathered some great mushrooms today, and they're all at reasonable prices!)]
			#ELSE
				 As [npc.she] notices your approach, the [npc.race] looks over at you, and in a cautious tone, confirms your suspicions, [npc.speech(Give me a moment to gather this, will you? I can sell you some mushrooms once I'm done...)]
			#ENDIF
		</p>
		<p>
			As [npc.she] quickly finishes gathering the mushrooms before [npc.herHim], you take a moment to look over this [npc.race]'s body, taking note of [npc.her] [npc.feminine]

		<p>
			Whether by some natural instinct, or perhaps some curious quirk of the arcane, you're instantly left with no doubt in your mind that the [npc.woman] in front of you is your [npc.relation(pc)]. From [npc.her] reaction, it's quite apparent that [npc.sheHas] recognised you as well, and as [npc.her] [npc.hands] reach up to cover [npc.her] [npc.mouth] in shock, you're left to decide how best to respond...

Deciding to take a quick detour to check in on [npc.herHim], you turn the corner and start to [pc.walk] towards [npc.herHim].
