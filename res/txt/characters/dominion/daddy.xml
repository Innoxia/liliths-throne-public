	<p>
		It being a suitable time of evening in which to go and meet and [daddy.herHim], you decide that now is the right moment in which to tell Lilaya about [daddy.name], and what the two of you discussed over dinner. As you mention [daddy.her] name, Lilaya lets out an annoyed sigh and rolls her eyes, but as you recount what [daddy.name] said about loving Lyssieth and wanting to marry her, Lilaya's expression shifts from irritation to one of curiosity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you're even half-way through your story, Lilaya interrupts, [lilaya.speech(Hold on, so <i>that's</i> what [daddy.she] wanted all this time? I thought [daddy.she] was trying to scam me... I guess that explains why [daddy.she] was so persistent...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Assuring Lilaya that you're beyond convinced that [daddy.name] is genuinely in love with Lyssieth, you then tell the rest of your tale, before finishing with the part about [daddy.herHim] wanting Lilaya to accept [daddy.herHim] as her new '[daddy.daddy]'. As she hears you say this, your [lilaya.relation(pc)]'s cheeks flush red, and, with her tail nervously wrapping around her left leg, she stammers, [lilaya.speech(W-What? [daddy.She] w-wants me to call [daddy.herHim]... '[daddy.daddy]'?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you confirm that that's [daddy.namePos] request, you can't help but notice a little gleam in Lilaya's [lilaya.eyeColour] eyes, and, after clearing her throat to shake off her earlier stutter, she says, [lilaya.speech(Well, it wouldn't be so bad to have someone step in as a father figure... I mean, I've never met my biological father, and mommy couldn't recall who it was either...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Lilaya seems to get a little annoyed towards the end of that last sentence, but, turning her thoughts to the future instead of the past, she continues, [lilaya.speech(I trust your judgement, [pc.name], and it might be fun having someone like that who I could visit now and again...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At this moment, Lilaya turns her head a little and casts a glance across at Rose, and as you follow her gaze over towards the cat-girl, you just about catch the end of her giving Lilaya an approving nod. Having obtained permission from the girl who's supposed to be her maid, Lilaya addresses you once more, [lilaya.speech(I'm not in the middle of any critical experiment at the moment, so let's head over to [daddy.her] place now. I should probably slip into something a little more suitable first, so can you wait by the front door while I get ready?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		While Lilaya and Rose hurry up the stairs to her bedroom, you head over to the entrance hall and wait for your [lilaya.relation(pc)] to get ready...

	<!-- FIRST_ENCOUNTER -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="FIRST_ENCOUNTER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		As you draw nearer to Lilaya's mansion, you see that the front door is being held open by Rose, and that an unfamiliar human, wearing blue jeans and a plain white t-shirt, is standing at the top of the stairs leading up to the doorstep, talking to her. He seems to be a construction worker of some sort, as you notice that he's holding a purple-coloured hard hat in one hand, while with the other, he appears to be trying to give the cat-girl maid a bouquet of flowers. Approaching the two characters before you, you hear the human plead, [daddy.speech(Please, she hasn't even heard me out!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[rose.speech(Mistress has already told me that she has no intention of meeting you, and furthermore, she's incredibly busy at the moment, so for the last time, leave her alone!)] Rose sharply snaps, and, clearly not having noticed you approaching, steps back and slams the door on his face.
	</p>
	<p>
		Letting out a defeated sigh, the human turns back towards the street, at which point he notices your approach. Flashing you a half-hearted smile, he says, [daddy.speech(Hey, if you're looking for a meeting with Lilaya, you'd be better off coming back tomorrow. Apparently, she's pretty busy today, and you don't want to piss off that maid of hers. Trust me on that one.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(pc.getSexualOrientation()!=ORIENTATION_GYNEPHILIC)
			You feel your heart beating a little faster as you look up and suddenly notice how handsome this tall, muscular man is. Although he only appears to be in his early forties, his hair is already a magnificent silvery-white in colour, and as you look upon his light-skinned face, you find yourself gazing into a pair of twinkling [daddy.eyeColour] eyes. It's at this moment that you suddenly realise there's something not quite 'human' about this person, and that although he appears to be one at first glance, these unusual features, combined with his strikingly-good looks and an air of arcane power that you sense surrounding him, reveal him to be a demon.

			As you step forwards, you find yourself looking up at this tall, muscular man.

It's at this moment that you suddenly realise there's something not quite 'human' about this person, and that although he appears to be one at first glance, these unusual features, combined with his undeniably-handsome face and an air of arcane power that you sense surrounding him, reveal him to be a demon.

	</p>
	<p>
		As the incubus starts to walk back down the short staircase, you wonder whether you should tell him that you live here, or simply push past and head inside.

	<htmlContent tag="FIRST_ENCOUNTER_ANSWER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding to let this incubus know who you are, you quickly tell him that not only do you live here, but that you're also related to Lilaya. As you reveal this information to him, the incubus suddenly becomes reinvigorated, and with a voice full of optimism, he exclaims, [daddy.speech(You're just the person I need to talk to! Look, I'm out of time right now, but if you could please pay me a visit at my place over in Demon Home one evening when you're free, I'll treat you to dinner in one of Dominion's finest restaurants! I work some pretty unusual shifts, so I'm only available between six and ten every evening. You can find me here...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Producing a business card from his left pocket, he pushes it into your hands before glancing at his watch and sharply inhaling, [daddy.speech(Damn, I knew I'd be cutting this close! I need to go! Please, I'm begging you, come and visit me whenever you can!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Leaving you no time in which to respond, he flashes you one last charming smile, before putting his hard hat back on, turning away, and then dashing off down the street. After briefly watching him run off, you glance down at the business card still in your [pc.hand], which informs you both of this curious incubus's address, as well as the fact that his name is '[daddy.name]'. Wondering what you'll do about his request to meet him, you turn towards Lilaya's mansion, before stepping up to the front door and giving it a knock.
	</p>
	<p>
		As usual, you only have to wait a moment before it swings open before you, bringing you face-to-face with Rose. Obviously having expected [daddy.name] to be the one who knocked, she looks a little surprised to see that it's you standing before her, but, quickly recovering, she dutifully stands aside to let you enter. As you step inside, she asks, [rose.speech(I don't suppose you saw an incubus leaving here just now?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After replying in the affirmative, Rose lets out a small sigh and asks, [rose.speech(You wouldn't be able to help us get rid of him for good, would you? He keeps on pestering mistress in the hopes of going out to dinner with her, even though he's been informed that she has absolutely no interest in such an arrangement. If you could go to his place and let him know not to bother us ever again, that would be most helpful. I can give you address, if you'll just bear with me a moment.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You tell Rose that he's already given you his business card, and, taking that as confirmation that you'll go and see him, Rose curtsies towards you before excusing herself and hurrying off in the direction of Lilaya's lab. Looking down at the card in your hand, you wonder whether you should head over to Demon Home and do as Rose asks, or perhaps once you're there you could give [daddy.name] a chance to explain himself...
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="FIRST_ENCOUNTER_PUSH_PAST"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding that nothing good will come from involving yourself with this unwelcome incubus, you simply stride past him up the steps to knock on the front door. Just as he starts to repeat his warning about not bothering Lilaya, the door swings open before you, and, much to his amazement, he watches as Rose curtsies towards you, before standing aside and letting you step past her.
	</p>
	<p>
		[daddy.speech(You live here?! Hey, wait, I need to speak to you! Please, let me buy you dinner one evenin-)] he starts to exclaim, but, taking your hint of not even turning around to look at him, Rose simply steps forwards and slams the door on his face.
	</p>
	<p>
		[rose.speech(Welcome home,)] the cat-girl maid says as she turns towards you, before asking, [rose.speech(You wouldn't be able to help us get rid of that nuisance for good, would you? He keeps on pestering mistress in the hopes of going out to dinner with her, even though he's been informed that she has absolutely no interest in such an arrangement. If you could go to his place and let him know not to bother us ever again, that would be most helpful. I can give you address, if you'll just bear with me a moment.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Still being indebted to Lilaya for everything she's done for you, you decide that it would be best to assist her with this problem, and watch as Rose quickly steps over towards a nearby cabinet, before opening a drawer and producing a small business card. Moving back over to stand before you, she hands over this card and explains, [rose.speech(This card lists his address, over in Demon Home. if you could pay him a visit and settle this matter for good, it would be most appreciated.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanking you for your help, Rose curtsies once more, before excusing herself and hurrying off in the direction of Lilaya's lab. Looking down at the card in your hand, you see that the incubus's name is '[daddy.name]'. Putting it away, you wonder whether you should head over to Demon Home and do as Rose asks, or perhaps once you're there you could give [daddy.name] a chance to explain himself...

Almost immediately, you hear sounds of movement beyond, and after just a few seconds, the door swings open before you, and you find yourself face-to-face with the silver-haired incubus once more.
	</p>
	<p>
		[daddy.speech(You're back?!)] he exclaims in surprise, before quickly recovering his composure and flashing you a charming smile. Grabbing his keys from off of the top of his hallway table, he then moves forwards as though to exit his apartment, saying, [daddy.speech(Come on, let me treat you to dinner. You can't keep on refusing me!)]

	<htmlContent tag="LILAYA_INITIAL_MEETING"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		After you've been waiting for about ten minutes, Lilaya finally comes back down the staircase, and you feel your eyes widening as you look upon a version of your [lilaya.relation(pc)] that you haven't seen before. Instead of her usual lab coat, shirt, and skirt, she's wearing a sleek black plunge dress, which clings to the curves of her body while showing off a generous amount of her ample cleavage. Her stiletto heels and pearl stud earrings, both as black as her dress, are also quite unlike anything you've seen her wear before, while her typically-loose hair has been tied up into a scrunchie-bound ponytail. 
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(So, what do you think?)] she hesitantly asks, stepping up before you, [lilaya.speech(Is this ok? Rose said it looks good, but I feel kind of uncomfortable in stuff like this...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Reassuring her that she looks stunning, you can't help but give your [lilaya.relation(pc)] an endearing smile as she blushes profusely and insists that the two of you leave immediately. Doing as she says, you join her in stepping out into the streets of Dominion, before heading off in the direction of Demon Home. The two of you make conversation the entire way there, and although a lot of it ends up revolving around the arcane experiments Lilaya has been performing recently, she also asks you lots of questions about what [daddy.name] is like. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After half an hour of walking, the two of you finally arrive at [daddy.namePos] apartment building, and after stepping inside and making your way up the staircase to the first floor, you quickly locate and knock on [daddy.her] door. Almost immediately, you hear sounds of movement beyond, and after just a few seconds, the door swings open before you, and you once again find yourself face-to-face with your new [daddy.daddy].
	</p>
	<p>
		Seeing both you and Lilaya standing before [daddy.herHim], [daddy.name] joyously smiles at you, before turning to your companion and exclaiming, [daddy.speech(I can't believe it! Finally, I get to meet you, Lilaya! I must say that you look every bit as beautiful as your mother!)]

						With that, your [daddy.daddy] ducks back into [daddy.her] apartment, before quickly appearing with a small bag of flames.

	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(W-Well, I-I... T-That is...)] Lilaya stammers, clearly struggling to find the right words. You're certain that she's trying to say yes, as she let you know on more than one occasion on the way over here that if she didn't like the look of [daddy.name], she was going to immediately turn around and march back home.

Not being deterred by this information in the slightest, he happily leads you out of the apartment building and across the street, towards a restaurant bearing the name 'Temptation'.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you approach, it's quite clear that this eatery must have an excellent reputation, as not only can you see through its large windows that all the tables are taken, but there's also a small queue lining up outside the front door. Asking [daddy.name] if he's intending to have you wait in this queue with him, he simply smirks across at you, before leading you past the line of potential diners and directly towards the entrance.
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		[daddy.speech(Don't you worry, [pc.name], I can always get a table here,)] [daddy.name] says, flashing you another of his charming smiles.
	</p>
	<p>
		After less than a minute, the waiter returns, and, beckoning the two of you forwards, he leads you to a clear table in the rear right-hand corner of the restaurant. After the two of you have been seated, he hands you each a menu, before informing you of the specials that the restaurant is serving this evening. Proceeding to tell you that he'll be back momentarily to take your orders for drinks, he then departs, leaving you and [daddy.name] alone.

Delivering this information in such a seductive manner immediately yields results, for, after shrugging off the fact that you're the bearer of bad news, and then leading you out of his apartment building, the handsome incubus reaches down to slip an arm around your waist. Telling you that he's happy to treat this like a date if you are, he holds you close as he leads you across the street towards a restaurant bearing the name 'Temptation'.

Lyssieth... It was as though I'd seen a vision of perfection itself... She was so graceful, and beautiful beyond imagining. It was at that moment that I knew I was destined to make her my wife.)]

I quickly found out that she only likes humans, hence this appearance I choose to take on, and, rather unfortunately, that she secludes herself in that fortified palace down in Submission. I tried countless times to get an audience with her, but those guards at the front gate made it quite clear that such a thing would be 'absolutely impossible'. It was then that I realised I was only trying to take on half of my future responsibilities; once we're married, I'll have to look after not only Lyssieth, but also all of her recognised children. Realising this, I decided to set out and convince her daughters that I'd make a suitable father for them. If I'm able to do that, Lyssieth will definitely want to meet me!)]

I'm willing to do anything it takes to be by Lyssieth's side, so I quickly accepted... She didn't look so powerful, despite all of her boasting and talk of 'destroying the universe', but I seriously underestimated her...

Unlike most female demons, however, [daddy.name] appears reluctant to fully embrace her feminine potential, choosing to give herself small, B-cup breasts, a girly pair of hips, and a barely-rounded ass. Her face, too, while definitely cute enough to be regarded as feminine, strays a little close to androgynous territory. Her height and hair have also changed, and she's now a good deal shorter than she was before, while her now-wavy, white hair has grown down to her shoulders, and is being held back from her face by means of a black sweatband. As she draws nearer, you can't help but notice that there's a visible bulge in her jeans, letting you know that she's still all-man where it counts...

			Wanting to do a little more than simply flirt with [daddy.name] this evening, you turn up the heat a little and start making some very sexual remarks, while playfully running your hand over [daddy.her] leg.
		#ELSE
			Deciding that you want to have a little fun this evening, you start flirting with [daddy.name], before leading up to asking [daddy.herHim] to come over and sit next to you on the sofa. After [daddy.she]'s done as you asked, you then turn up the heat by starting to make some very sexual remarks, while playfully running your hand over [daddy.her] leg.

		 More than eager to play along, your [daddy.daddy] leans in close to you, and the next time you gaze longingly into [daddy.her] [daddy.eyeColour] [daddy.eyes+], [daddy.she] suddenly leans forwards and presses [daddy.her] lips against yours.
	</p>
		Before you know what's happening, the two of you are thrusting your tongues into one another's mouths, while your [pc.hands] are desperately roaming all over each other's bodies. Quickly stripping your [daddy.daddy]'s t-shirt off, you press your lips down against [daddy.her] [daddy.breasts+], kissing [daddy.her] [daddy.nipples+] as you reach down to start slipping off your own clothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		With [daddy.name] helping you to undress in record time, your garments are soon thrown all over the floor. Now standing face-to-face, [daddy.name] locks [daddy.her] [daddy.eyes+] onto yours and commands, [daddy.speech(That's [daddy.daddy]'s good [pc.girl]... Now get on my bed and present yourself to me...)]

			Deciding that you want to have a little fun this evening, you start flirting with your two companions, before leading up to asking [daddy.name] to come over and sit between you and Lilaya on the sofa. After [daddy.she]'s done as you asked, you then turn up the heat by starting to make some very sexual remarks, while playfully running your hand over [daddy.her] leg.

		 More than eager to play along, your [daddy.daddy] puts [daddy.her] arms around you and Lilaya, and the next time your [lilaya.relation(pc)] gazes hungrily into [daddy.namePos] [daddy.eyeColour] [daddy.eyes+], [daddy.she] suddenly leans forwards and presses [daddy.her] lips against hers.

		Before you know what's happening, you and Lilaya are taking turns to thrust your tongues into [daddy.namePos] mouth, while your [pc.hands] are desperately roaming all over [daddy.her] body. Stripping your [daddy.daddy]'s t-shirt off, you press your lips down against [daddy.her] [daddy.breasts+], kissing [daddy.her] [daddy.nipples+] as Lilaya once again desperately presses her [lilaya.lips+] against [daddy.her] mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just a moment later, you find yourself standing next to Lilaya, helping her to slip off her plunge dress and reveal her matching pair of lacy black panties and bra. Pulling back to return the favour, Lilaya runs her hands over your body, helping you to strip off your outer layers as your [daddy.daddy] steps forwards and gives you your turn of having [daddy.her] tongue explore the insides of your mouth.

		With you and Lilaya stripped to your underwear in record time, [daddy.name] pulls back, before moving [daddy.her] [daddy.eyes+] up over your exposed bodies and ordering, [daddy.speech(That's [daddy.daddy]'s good

		Saying that you enjoyed your time together, and that you'll be sure to visit [daddy.herHim] again soon, you and Lilaya say goodbye to your [daddy.daddy]. Allowing [daddy.name] to lead you to the front door, the two of you make your exit, heading down the stairs before stepping back out into Demon Home. Agreeing to accompany your [lilaya.relation(pc)] back to her mansion, you set off by her side, talking with one another about your evening the entire way there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Roughly half an hour later the two of you arrive back home, and after Rose has let you in, Lilaya thanks you for your company, before heading off upstairs with her cat-girl maid to get changed. Being left alone in the hallway, you wonder what to do next...
