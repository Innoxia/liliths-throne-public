		Putting on your most seductive voice, you step close to [npc.name] and ask, [pc.speech(You know, if you're feeling stressed from all this work, maybe I could help you to blow off some steam?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		A desperate little whine escapes from [npc.her] mouth, and before you can say anything else, the [npc.race] grabs you by the [pc.arm] and pulls you towards where [npc.her] cart is parked. Covering the distance in just a few long strides, [npc.name] leads you around to the other side of the vehicle, where you discover that the many wooden boxes which constitute the cart's cargo blocks the view down a narrow alley from the rest of the street.
	</p>
	<p>
		[npc.speech(Ah, fuck! I'm so horny!)] [npc.name] whines, pulling you a little way down the alley before turning and wrapping [npc.her] arms around you. [npc.speech(I was told Dominion was the place to go for an easy fuck, but I've been so caught up in work that I haven't met anyone but you! Please, let's just fuck already!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You can't say no to that, and as [npc.name] presses [npc.her] [npc.lips] against yours, you return the [npc.race]'s passionate embrace...

			Wanting to speak with [npc.name] again, you look around for a little while, before eventually spotting [npc.herHim] issuing orders to some of [npc.her] workers. Walking up to [npc.herHim], you call out a greeting, [pc.speech(Hi, [npc.name]!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			[npc.Name] turns around to see who's calling [npc.herHim], and you see a smile break out across [npc.her] face as [npc.she] sees that it's you. [npc.speech(Hello again, [pc.name]!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			You spend a little while making small talk and getting to know [npc.name] a little better. Most of [npc.her] interests seem to be related to snow in one way or another, and you're a little relieved when [npc.she] finally brings the conversation to a close, [npc.speech(I really should be getting on with work, but if you wanted to take a look at the goods I've got for sale, I could spare some time for that.)]
		</p>
	#ELSE
		<p>
			You notice that there are quite a few reindeer-morphs in this part of Dominion; each one of them busily shovelling snow in order to keep the streets clear. Deciding that you'd like to have a chat, you walk up to several of them and say hello. You're somewhat discouraged, however, when you discover that they're so engrossed in their work that they pay no heed to your attempts to strike up a conversation. Just as you're about to give up, a [npc.feminine] voice rings out from behind you, [npc.speech(Can I help?)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Turning around, you find yourself face-to-face with a particularly imposing [npc.race]. [npc.She] crosses [npc.her] arms and starts tapping [npc.her] foot on the ground as [npc.she] impatiently continues, [npc.speech(I'm [npc.name], the overseer for the workers in this area. If you're looking for something to buy, we've brought some goods with us, just like we do every year. You fancy a look?)]
		</p>
		#IF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasEncounteredAnyReindeers())
			<p>
				Feeling happy now that you've found the overseer for this particular group, you reply, [pc.speech(What sort of goods do you have? I've spoken with another overseer already, and they mostly had Yuletide-related clothing, food and drink, as well as some clothing from the youko.)]
			</p>
			<p>
				The [npc.race] smiles as [npc.she] answers, [npc.speech(Well, all of us reindeer-morphs travel together, so we've got the same goods as any of the other groups. Still, if you'd like to take a look, just let me know.)]
			</p>
		#ELSE
			<p>
				Feeling happy now that you've got an opportunity to talk to one of these reindeer-morphs, you reply, [pc.speech(What sort of goods do you have? And where did all of you come from? I haven't seen reindeer-morphs here in Dominion before.)]
			</p>
			<p>
				The [npc.race] smiles as [npc.she] answers, [npc.speech(We travel here from our homeland out in the frozen tundra every winter. We stay here to work until the end of February, which is when it stops snowing, and then we migrate back to the tundra for the rest of the year, which is why you haven't seen us before. As to what goods I can offer, we've brought plenty of the food, drink, and clothing that we make in our homeland. We travelled through the Shinrin highlands this year, so I also have some of the youko's traditional clothing which we traded for.)]

			[npc.Name] lets out a little sigh. [npc.speech(We're a little undermanned this year, so if you're looking for work, I can offer a part-time job. If not, and if you're not interested in trading, then I really need to get back to work; we've got so much to get done today!)]

	</p>
	<p>
		[npc.speech(Almost everything!)] [npc.name] replies with a laugh, [npc.speech(but it'd be a lot easier to manage if you choose just one thing to focus on. If you're feeling strong, then you could help out directly by joining in and shovelling snow. If you're any good with the arcane, we've got a few heat-staves on the cart; you can use them to channel your aura into a beam of arcane fire, which is very useful for helping to break up sections of densely-packed snow. And finally, if you're better with people than you are with physical or arcane work, then going around between the workers and delivering drinks and words of encouragement would be a great help.)]
