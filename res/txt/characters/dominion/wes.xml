			 As you're passing a slow-moving group of obnoxiously-loud revellers, you suddenly notice that an orange-furred, greater fox-boy, dressed in a grey hoodie and blue jeans, keeps on glancing your way from over on the other side of the street. Although his gaze is hidden behind a pair of dark glasses, you can tell that he's got some kind of particular interest in you. As your path around the crowd brings you closer to where he's standing, you see the fox-boy suddenly begin to move towards you, and as he sees that you've noticed his approach, he smiles and asks, [wes.speech(If I'm not mistaken, then you're [pc.name], right?)]

			 As you're passing a slow-moving group of obnoxiously-loud revellers, you suddenly see that an orange-furred, greater fox-boy, dressed in a grey hoodie and blue jeans, is rapidly moving towards you. Although his gaze is hidden behind a pair of dark glasses, you can tell that he's got some kind of particular interest in you, and before you can react to his approach, he smiles and asks, [wes.speech(If I'm not mistaken, then you're [pc.name], right?)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		The warm, friendly tone of this mysterious character's voice is not quite what you were expecting, and from his subtle country accent, you get the strong impression that he's not a native city-dweller. Despite his endearing manner of speech, you detect a sense of urgency in this middle-aged fox-boy's question, and so, seeing no harm in answering him, you quickly reply that you are indeed [pc.name].
	</p>
	<p>
		Retrieving a very official-looking SWORD Enforcer badge from out of his hoodie's pocket, this stranger flashes it at you and reveals, [wes.speech(I know that you're the one who dealt with that sticky situation up in the Harpy Nests, which is why I've come to you for help. I can't talk for too long out in the streets like this, but if you want to help the Enforcers again, then-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly getting spooked by the sight of something further down the street, the fox-boy interrupts his hasty explanation to ask, [wes.speech(Please, meet me outside the antiques shop in the Shopping Arcade between one and two in the afternoon. I'll be there every day, but it would be best if you were there tomorrow. Look, I have to go. Meet me there, ok?)]

	</p>

		Hastily striding over to the other side of the street, the fox-boy quickly blends in to one of the crowds that are passing by, and before you know it, you've lost track of him entirely.

		Offering you no further opportunity in which to ask him further questions, the fox-boy hastily strides over to the other side of the street, before quickly blending in to one of the crowds that are passing by.

			Wanting to talk with Wes again, you decide to wait here outside of the antiques shop in the hopes that you'll be able to meet with him. Just like the last time you did this, the fox-boy doesn't show up for a good five minutes, but eventually you see him walking towards you from the same direction as which you arrived.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wearing the same blue jeans and grey hoodie that he was wearing the last time you saw him, the fox-boy steps up to you and asks in a friendly tone, [wes.speech(So, you decided to come back? Have you had a change of mind about helping me?)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Still not entirely convinced that you want to help Wes, you ask him once again what exactly it is that he wants you to do. Taking off his dark glasses to once again reveal his bright green eyes, the fox-boy explains, [wes.speech(I'm convinced that my superior officer, Elle, is doing some shady dealings during her long Wednesday lunch breaks. I need you to find out where she's going, and then to collect evidence of her illegal activities. I can't go myself as I have no time in which to follow her, and I can't report this for an internal investigation without solid evidence of Elle's wrongdoing. Please, I need your help.)]

		<p>
			Wanting to find out more about the mysterious Enforcer who approached you in Dominion's streets, you decide to wait here outside of the antiques shop in the hopes that you'll be able to meet with him again. Unfortunately, despite being in the correct place, at the correct time, you don't see any sign of the fox-boy, and after five minutes spent waiting for him to show up, you start to wonder whether it would be a good idea to come back and try again tomorrow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as you're thinking of leaving, however, you suddenly spot the mysterious Enforcer walking towards you from the same direction as which you arrived. Wearing the same blue jeans and grey hoodie that he was wearing the last time you saw him, the fox-boy steps up to you and says in a friendly tone, [wes.speech(Thanks for meeting me here, [pc.name]. Sorry that I left you waiting for a while; I had to make sure that you weren't being followed.)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Taking off his dark glasses, the orange-furred fox-boy reveals a pair of bright green eyes, which, unlike the usual shiftiness foxes are stereotyped for, project a disarming, folksy naivet√© which perfectly matches his soft county accent. Smiling at you, he finally reveals who he is by saying, [wes.speech(My name's Wesley Wormwood, but everyone just calls me Wes for short. As you've already seen from my badge, I'm one of SWORD's Chief Inspectors, and I work over at the main HQ as a Junior Quartermaster. Sorry for not introducing myself to you earlier, but I was a little pressed for time. The reason I wanted to meet with you is to ask for your help in the investigation of my superior officer.)]

			Pausing for a moment, the fox-boy gives you an opportunity in which to respond to what he's just said...

	<p>
		Wanting to know more, and thinking that it would be best to start at the beginning, you ask Wes what exactly his superior officer is doing which would warrant them being investigated. After quickly glancing around to make sure that nobody's eavesdropping, the fox-boy explains, [wes.speech(The officer I'm talking about is '[elle.name] [elle.surname]', but everyone just calls her 'Elle'; she's the Senior Quartermaster over at Enforcer HQ. Me and her are the only two who have access to the station's inventory, and I've noticed over the past few weeks that equipment has started to go missing. It started with the odd pistol or a couple of batons, but just two days ago I discovered that even several of the cryoprism guns now only exist on paper. It <i>has</i> to be her who's taking them.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(So you want me to find out what she's doing with them?)] you ask, picking up on where Wes is going with his explanation.
	</p>
	<p>
		[wes.speech(That's right. I'd try to investigate all of this myself, but the problem is that Elle teleports out of her office every Wednesday lunch time, and there's no way for me to follow her. I'm convinced that that's when she's selling these weapons to criminal gangs, but there's nothing I can do to stop her.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Why not have this investigated internally?)] you ask, wondering why Wes has sought out your help instead of reporting this to his superiors.
	</p>
	<p>
		[wes.speech(Elle's a half-demon, so internal investigations always get really messy when one of them is involved. Besides, if she were tipped off that she was being investigated, she'd no doubt set me up as the guilty party, and who do you think's going to be believed? Some fox from the sticks, or his half-demon superior officer, who, I'm told, is the child of a direct daughter of Lunette herself?)] Wes sighs, pausing for a moment to collect his thoughts before continuing, [wes.speech(After I heard of your work up in the Harpy Nests, I was hoping that I could ask for your help with all of this...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Wanting to hear exactly what it is that Wes is wanting of you before deciding whether to help him or not, you ask the fox-boy what his plan is.
	</p>
	<p>
		[wes.speech(I'll need you to gather incriminating evidence of Elle selling Enforcer weapons to criminals,)] he states, before producing what looks to be some kind of miniature video recorder from out of his hoodie's spacious front pocket and explaining, [wes.speech(I've requisitioned this arcane recording device, so all you need to do is find out where Elle's teleporting off to, and then to use this to record evidence of her illegal activities.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With one final question left on your mind, you ask Wes how you're supposed to find Elle. After all, if she's teleporting off to somewhere, it could be literally anywhere in all of Lilith's Realm.
	</p>
	<p>
		[wes.speech(That's going to be the hard part in all of this,)] the fox-boy sighs, [wes.speech(All I can tell you is that she conducts this illegal business during her long lunch breaks every Wednesday, and that she takes a pair of night vision goggles with her. When she returns, her shoes are often wet and sometimes have trace amounts of some kind of glowing residue on them...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Having now heard all of the information Wes has to offer you, you wonder whether you should agree to help him by tracking down Elle and collecting evidence of her criminal activities, or tell the fox-boy that you're not interested in getting tangled up in his mess. As you're wondering what to say, Wes holds out the arcane recorder and asks, [wes.speech(Please, [pc.name], can you help me with this? If all goes according to plan, I'll be able to arrange a decent reward for you.)]

		Although you're certain that you can trust Wes to be telling the truth about the situation with Elle's criminal activities, you really don't like the idea of getting tangled up in the Enforcer's internal affairs. Telling the fox-boy that you're unwilling to do as he asks, you [pc.step] back from him and prepare to leave.
	</p>
	<p>
		[wes.speech(Well, I don't blame you; it seems to be the common attitude in this city for everyone to look out for themselves and never stick their neck out to help anyone,)] he cynically remarks, before putting the arcane recorder back in his hoodie's pocket and letting out a deep sigh. Putting his dark glasses back on, he turns and starts to walk off into the Shopping Arcade, calling after him as he goes, [wes.speech(If you change your mind, I'll be here at the same time tomorrow...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Wes walks off, leaving you with little else to do except continue on your way...

	<p>
		Telling Wes that you'll do as he asks, you take the arcane recorder from him and listen as he instructs you on how to operate it. The device seems simple enough to use, and after you've told the fox-boy that you're confident in your ability at using it, he smiles and says, [wes.speech(Right, once you've tracked down Elle and recorded her illegal activities, you'll need to deposit this recorder in one of our anonymous evidence drop-boxes. Just ask that bimbo at the HQ's front desk where it is, or if you're down in Submission, then all of the Enforcer posts down there have one. After handing the evidence in, wait at least one week for the internal investigation to conclude, and then go back to the HQ's front desk and ask to see me. I'll have a reward for you then.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling Wes that you understand what to do, you watch as he puts his dark glasses back on and flashes you another of his warm smiles. Letting out a happy little chuckle, he says, [wes.speech(I guess not everyone in this city is as selfish as I thought. Thanks for agreeing to help, [pc.name]. Remember, don't come looking for me until at least a week after you've handed in the evidence. Oh, and don't mention any of this to any other Enforcers; they may mean well, but if word of this gets out, you'll be dropping me in pretty hot water...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Wes walks off, leaving you to put the arcane recording device away and wonder to yourself where Elle could be conducting her illegal business. Thinking back on what Wes told you, the main points were:
		<i>
		<br/>She takes [style.colourOrange(unusually long lunch breaks)].
		<br/>She only does this on a [style.colourOrange(Wednesday)].
		<br/>She takes a set of [style.colourOrange(night vision goggles)] with her.
		<br/>Afterwards, her [style.colourOrange(shoes are often wet)] and sometimes have trace amounts of some kind of [style.colourOrange(glowing residue on them)].
		</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Thinking back on those points, you feel confident that you can figure out where Elle is going, but if not, you realise that you could always go to Lilaya and ask for her help. With that comforting thought in mind, you set off and continue on your way...

	<p>
		Having figured out that Elle must be conducting her illegal activities in the Bat Caverns, and with it currently being the correct day and time in which to find her down here, you start searching for any clue as to her whereabouts. With these caves being as vast and as dark as they are, you don't hold out much hope of finding Elle on your first try, but by a stroke of particular good fortune, you quickly stumble upon evidence of what appears to be the trail of heavy crates having been dragged through a patch of luminescent fungi.
	</p>
	<p>
		Following this trail down several twists and turns in the maze-like network of caves, you soon find yourself [pc.stepping] out into an underground forest of huge, bioluminescent mushrooms. The carpet of glowing fungi which covers the ground before you has been heavily trodden-down in places, allowing you to continue following the path of whoever has travelled this way before you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Following the trail for just a little further, you discover that it leads to a small cave, the entrance to which is almost completely concealed by an abnormally-thick patch of tree-like mushrooms. Concerned that Elle might already be inside, you proceed towards the entrance of this cave with caution, but thankfully, as you peer around one of the mushroom's thick trunks, you see that the interior appears to be completely deserted...
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	
	<!-- ELLE_SEARCH_CAVE -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="ELLE_SEARCH_CAVE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Making sure to keep a sharp lookout for any sign of Elle, you squeeze your way around the huge mushrooms which conceal the cave's entrance, before [pc.stepping] inside and starting to take a look around. Immediately, you see that this is definitely the place which you're looking for, as there are numerous piles of both locked and empty crates stacked up against the cave's walls, with more than a couple of them displaying signs of crudely scraped-off SWORD insignias.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you approach these crates to take a closer look, you suddenly hear the sound of feminine, flirty laughter coming from somewhere outside of the cave. Stopping dead in your tracks, you listen as this laughter suddenly cuts off, only to be quickly followed by a slovenly male voice asking, [style.speechMasculineHeavy('Ow much fuckin' further 'ave we gots ta go?! You's better not be settin' us up!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elle.speech(Oh, please,)] the flirty voice of the woman replies, [elle.speech(If I wanted to set you up, you'd all be under arrest by now! As it so happens, the weapons I promised you are right inside that cave. Please follow me.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Realising that these people intend to enter the cave which you're currently occupying, you quickly look around for a place in which to hide and secretly record evidence of Elle's criminal activity. Thankfully, an empty space behind a particularly large stack of empty crates provides the perfect place in which to conceal yourself, and you manage to duck down into this recess just in time before Elle and several thuggish gang members enter the cave.
	</p>
	<p>
		Peering through a slender gap in the crates, you're able to get a good look of Elle, who turns out to be a greater [elle.race] who looks to be in her early forties. As is the case for most people with demonic blood, Elle's brown-furred anthropomorphic horse-like face is stunningly beautiful, and there's an energetic, excited look in her [elle.eyeColour] demonic eyes. Her SWORD uniform conceals most of her fit body, but you can still quite clearly see that she's got a huge pair of [elle.cupSize]-cup breasts, as well as wide, womanly hips and a large ass.
	</p>
	<p>
		As she turns to one side to beckon the gang members into the cave, you're able to see that Elle's horse-like tail is the same sandy blonde colour as her hair, which is tied up into a smart bun. Growing from her shoulder-blades, you see that she she has a pair of large, lilac-skinned demonic wings, while a long, indigo unicorn horn grows from her upper forehead. Having taken a good look at Elle's appearance, you turn your attention to the group of rat, alligator, and dog-morph gang-members who are roughly pushing their way past the mushrooms and into the cave.
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking out the arcane recorder which Wes gave to you, you point the lens through the gap in the crates and start filming the scene in front of you...
	</p>

	<!-- ELLE_SEARCH_CAVE_RECORDING -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="ELLE_SEARCH_CAVE_RECORDING"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		With your arcane recorder capturing video and audio footage of all that's happening in the cave, you watch as the rough-looking dog-boy leader of the gang-members steps up to the nearest crate and demands, [style.speechMasculineHeavy(Show us wot ya got then! You's ain't gettin' no flames from me until I sees that you's got the goods ya promised to us!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Teasing the dog-boy by brushing her hand over his arm, Elle laughs, [elle.speech(My, my, you are impatient, aren't you?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Grunting in amusement at the Enforcer's flirty attitude, the dog-boy hungrily watches as Elle turns her back on him and bends down at the waist to unlock the crate he pointed to. Stepping aside to let the gang-members take a look inside, Elle teases, [elle.speech(Go on then, boys, choose whatever you like! My prices are most reasonable, I can assure you.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Seeing weakness in Elle's attitude, one of the rat-boy gang-members pulls a pistol out of the crate, before brazenly waving it at the Enforcer and sneering, [style.speechMasculine('O said anythin' about us payin' fer this? Heh-heh-heh! Now we's got the guns, 'o's ta stop us from 'avin' a little fun with you!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Instantly, Elle drops her flirty, light-hearted act, but while her face takes on a grim expression, you can't help but notice the way her eyes light up at the prospect of trouble. Exhibiting an alarming display of speed, the Enforcer darts forwards, and after effortlessly knocking the pistol out of the rat-boy's hands, she grabs hold of him by the neck and violently slams him down onto the floor. 
	</p>
	<p>
		[style.speechMasculineHeavy(Woah, woah, woah! We ain't wantin' no trouble!)] the leader of the gang nervously shouts, [style.speechMasculineHeavy('E was only jokin' 'bout not payin'! Look, I's got the flames 'ere, 'ow much do ya-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elle.speech(I don't give a damn about your money,)] Elle snaps, cutting the gang-member off. Advancing towards him with her wings unfurled, she reveals, [elle.speech(I'm not doing this to get rich! You scum are too soft; do you know how boring it is to be an Enforcer these days?! Oh, what I'd give to go back to the crime waves of the late 70's, or for the fifth human rebellion to still be ongoing. Where's the fun in subduing pathetic, bottom-feeding losers like you lot? Perhaps if these weapons got out onto the streets, however, and a new crime wave started, then I'd get to relive the glory days...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Sensing that they're in very real danger of being on the receiving end of Elle's wrath, the gang-members wisely choose not to interrupt her monologue. Waiting until she's calmed down and folded her wings back into place, the dog-boy leader of the gang holds out a bag of money to Elle, saying, [style.speechMasculineHeavy(A-A deal's a deal, right? We's givin' you's this cash so we can 'ave the weapons, ok? We ain't wantin' no trouble...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After taking a deep breath, Elle assumes her previous, flirty demeanour, and after gently taking the bag of flames from the dog-boy, she teases, [elle.speech(That's a good boy. As I stated before, I don't care much for your money, but I suppose I could use this to fund some other gang activities... Anyway, have fun with all of the guns, and please do try to cause as much trouble as you can.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Elle is suddenly enveloped in a bright flash of purple arcane energy, and after you've blinked away the after-image that's been momentarily burned into your vision, you see that she's vanished. Letting out a deep sigh of relief, the gang's leader steps over to the still-prone form of the rat-boy who threatened Elle, before kicking him and grunting, [style.speechMasculineHeavy(Ya fuckin' idiot! You's almost got us all fuckin' killed there! Now grab as many o' these weapons as ya can carry, then let's get out o' 'ere before that crazy bitch returns.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, the crates which you're hiding behind have all been emptied by what you assume to be Elle's previous dealings, and so none of the gang-members approach your hiding place. Continuing to film the gang as they encumber themselves with armfuls of pistols, batons, rifles, and all manner of highly-illegal Enforcer weaponry, you watch and wait until they've exited the cave, before turning the recording device off and putting it away into your inventory. Not wanting to hang around and risk the chance of Elle or the gang suddenly returning, you prepare to follow in their footsteps and head back out into the Bat Caverns...

	</p>
	<p>
		As you're considering what to do next, a sudden thought enters your head, and you suppose that if you really wanted to, you could seek out Elle and betray Wes's plan to her. If you were to decide to do this, you think that you could probably locate Elle leaving work outside the Enforcer HQ between [units.time(16)]-[units.time(18)].

	<p>
		Deciding to betray Wes and side with Elle, you wait outside the Enforcer HQ for the [elle.race] to leave work for the day. Choosing a shaded spot on the opposite side of the street to the imposing building which serves as the Enforcer's Dominion Headquarters, you wait and watch for any sign of her.
	</p>
	<p>
		After forty-five minutes of loitering around in this manner, you start to think that you might have missed her, or that perhaps she didn't come in to work today. Just as you're starting to wonder whether or not it would be too brazen to ask to see Elle at the HQ's front desk, you suddenly catch sight of her stepping out of the front entrance at the side of a cat-boy Enforcer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not wanting to approach her while she's got company, you watch as Elle dominantly steps around in front of the cat-boy and starts correcting his uniform. Although the two of them are too far away to be able to hear, you can tell from their body language that Elle is heavily hitting on the cat-boy. After straightening his tie, the [elle.race] drops her hand down between the Enforcer's legs and gives his groin a firm grope.
	</p>
	<p>
		This seems to be too much for the cat-boy to handle, as he steps back and holds up his hands to try and tell Elle that she's going too far. Clearly not being one to take no for an answer, the [elle.race] steps aside to let the cat-boy pass, but as he does so, she gives his ass a firm slap and calls out after him loud enough for you to hear, [elle.speech(You're to report to my office first thing tomorrow morning! I've got a <i>thorough</i> debriefing planned for you!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As the cat-boy hurries past you with an apprehensive look on his face, Elle's attention is suddenly drawn to you.
		#IF(pc.hasStatusEffect(SE_dsg_set_hlf_regular) || pc.hasStatusEffect(SE_dsg_set_hlf_insurgent))
		 She glances over your salvaged gear and immediately tenses up. Her hands glow with arcane power before her gleaming pink eyes fix themselves on your face. She studies you intently for a brief moment and, apparently deciding that you're more of a curiosity than a threat, relaxes while the spell she was preparing fades. She takes a more casual stance, waiting for you to approach.

		After simply telling her your name, Elle displays her quick-thinking by immediately responding, [elle.speech(So <i>you're</i> [pc.name]. Yes, I know about you. I read the report on the pacification of the Harpy Nests, and, if I may say so, you did a most excellent job up there.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Deciding that you're a suitable target to try and seduce, the horny Enforcer steps closer and flashes you a cheeky smile, before asking, [elle.speech(Perhaps you heard something about me from one of the Enforcers up there? Go on, tell me all the naughty things they said about me...)]

	<p>
		Wanting to get this business with Wes finished as soon as possible, you ignore Elle's teasing and show her the arcane recorder which the fox-boy gave to you. A puzzled look flashes across the [elle.race]'s face as she sees what it is you're holding, and teases, [elle.speech(What's this? You're wanting to record us while we fuck? How kinky... Those arcane recorders aren't cheap, either...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Flipping out the screen that's built into the side of the recorder, you show Elle the footage of her selling weapons to the gang down in the cave in the Bat Caverns. Explaining to her how it was Wes that tried to get her arrested, you look up to see that there's a grim expression on Elle's face. Dropping her seductive tone as she realises how serious this is, she flatly states, [elle.speech(You've done well to bring this to my attention. How careless I was not to search the cave upon entering it... Now hand over that recorder, if you please.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As this was your intention all along, you do as Elle asks and give her the arcane recorder. Immediately, she throws it to the ground, and before you have a chance to say anything, she uses her arcane power to cast a spell. Projecting a wave of crushing force down upon the helpless arcane device, Elle instantly obliterates it, sending tiny fragments of metal and plastic all over the street. Ignoring the curious looks which several members of the public cast her way, the [elle.race] looks back up at you and states, [elle.speech(I need to fix this situation before that damn fox-boy reports me. Come back after a week and ask for me at the front desk, and I'll give you a handsome reward for your loyalty.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With a dark look in her eyes, Elle turns back towards the Enforcer HQ, before quickly striding across the grounds and heading inside. Finding yourself alone out in the street, you have little else to do but continue on your way, wondering what kind of reward will be given to you when you return to meet Elle next week...

	</p>
	<p>
		The dim-witted cat-girl presses the button that's quite clearly marked as 'Requisitions', and after letting out a low-pitched buzzing noise, the arcane intercom's speaker crackles into life, and you hear the familiar voice of Wes asking, [wes.speech(What is it now, Candi? Don't tell me that you've lost your jacket <i>again</i>...)]

	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(Uh, like, that's kinda rude of you to think that, y'know? I'm actually doing my job for once, thank you very much!)] Candi drawls, [candi.speech(There's, like, [pc.a_race] here at the front desk for you. Are you, like, expecting someone called '[pc.name]'?)]

	<p>
		Sinking down into the executive leather chair positioned behind his desk, Wes lets out a deep, happy sigh and reveals, [wes.speech(Thanks to the evidence you gathered, the internal investigation of Elle all went according to my plan. By taking an active role in the investigation, I managed to secure this promotion to Superintendent which I've been chasing for years.

		[wes.speech(I told you that I'd put it in the top drawer!)] the familiar voice of Wes calls out from somewhere within the maze of shelving units which fill the vast storage area behind the counter. A moment later, the fox-boy steps into view, and you see that while he looks just as he did the last time you saw him, he's now wearing nothing but a metal slave collar and a pair of black boxers. Catching sight of you waiting behind the counter, Wes flashes you a furious look, before angrily asking, [wes.speech(So, are you happy with what you've done? This criminal keeps her job, and I'm the one who got punished for her crimes!)]

		[elle.speech(Now, now, Wes,)] Elle tuts, before stepping over to her slave and fondly pulling him into her ample cleavage.

Look, if you're really upset, I'll let you use my pussy tonight. You liked that little 'defeated Elle' roleplay we tried the other night, didn't you?)]

		Clearly getting extremely embarrassed about Elle saying all of this right in front of you, the fox-boy pushes his owner off of him, before storming over to the counter and retrieving the contractor pass from out of the top drawer. Throwing it over to Elle, he huffs, [wes.speech(I've still got three boxes of assorted uniforms left to catalogue and store away. If there's nothing else you need from me, then I'm getting back to work.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elle.speech(Once I've finished my business with [pc.name] here, I'll come and join you,)] Elle teases, before turning her attention back to you. Handing you the contractor pass, which turns out to be a plastic id card attached to a pink lanyard, Elle says, [elle.speech(This will unlock the doors to this area, and if you show it to an Enforcer patrol, they won't try and confiscate any of the gear you purchase from me here. You can buy gear from me here at any time during my working hours, which are from nine to five. Of course, if you wanted to just chat, or perhaps have a little fun in my office, then I'll always be happy to see you...)]

			[wes.speech(Before I joined the Enforcers? Well, that would be before I came to Dominion,)] Wes recalls, and you can't help but notice how his country accent gets a lot stronger as he thinks back to his past, [wes.speech(I spent my early life working on my parents' farm, out on the fringes of the Foloi Fields. Being the youngest of my eight siblings, I realised that I didn't stand much of a chance of inheriting anything, so rather than stay there and find out what ploughing fields would be like with a back bent by age, I decided to travel to the big city.)]

			At this point in his story, the fox-boy's muzzle turns up into a wry grin, and he scoffs, [wes.speech(I was so naive and foolish back then... I didn't realise how opportunistic and self-serving the majority of city folks are. I went from job to job, always being promised steady work, only to be laid off or replaced by cheaper labour a few weeks after I'd started.)]

Oh yes, I'd been working odd jobs for a few months, and had finally saved up enough to rent a half-decent apartment. On my way to pay the landlord, I foolishly decided to take a shortcut through some alleyways, and ran straight into a pair of muggers...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Seemingly obsessed with her owner's cock, Elle steps forwards once again and leans heavily into Wes's back, before slipping her hand down to gently tease his groin. Interrupted once again, the fox-boy lets out a sigh and finishes his story by saying, [wes.speech(Anyway, to cut a long story short, I ended up being saved from the muggers by a passing Enforcer patrol. Being the impressionable young fool I was, I saw those kind Enforcers as being representative of all the realm's law enforcement, and quickly convinced myself that I should apply to join them...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Unable to ignore Elle's hand as it slips down into his trousers, Wes apologises, [wes.speech(Sorry, if you're interested in hearing more, ask me about this some other time. Elle here is being particularly difficult today!)]

The work there wasn't bad, mind you, but I just felt like I was missing out on something being stuck there...)]

My siblings are all still working on the farm or in the village, and none of them have any ambition to ever leave.)]

For the next few years after that I worked as a regular Patrol officer, and despite there being some obvious signs of corruption, I chose to ignore them.

		</p>
		<p>
			[elle.speech(What about your first arrest?)] Elle asks, seemingly just as curious as you are to hear more about Wes's early days as an Enforcer.
		</p>
		<p>
			[wes.speech(Looking back at it, I found it exciting at the time, sure,)] Wes admits, [wes.speech(It really wasn't anything special though. We'd got reports of a huge, aggressive wolf-boy mugging people in an alleyway close to HQ, and so I was sent with a more experienced partner to track him down and get him enslaved. We found him quickly enough, and instead of running, he actually tried to fight back.)]

To say that the training was brutal is a gross understatement, and despite the fact that you can only ever apply for SWORD once in your life, over half of my fellow recruits had dropped out after the first couple of weeks.
