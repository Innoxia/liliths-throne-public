		Much to your delight, your would-be attacker reaches up and grabs you by the [pc.arms], before pulling you forwards into a tight embrace.

		With your struggles doing nothing to dissuade [npc.name] from [npc.her] chosen course of action, [npc.she] growls, [npc.speech(I hope you're ready for this, you dirty slut!!)]
