		Being built in an extremely imposing example of brutalist architecture, the vast structure before you is strikingly different from the usual residential buildings which Dominion is mostly comprised of. A wide courtyard, paved in drab, grey flagstones and cordoned off with chain bollards, separates the street on which you're standing from this unusual property. Looking up at the fa√ßade, which is made almost entirely out of sheets of reflective glass and thick pillars of grey concrete, you see that there's a sign bearing the words 'Enforcer Headquarters, Greyhaven Park'.
	</p>

		As if the sign wasn't enough to reveal this establishment's purpose to any passersby, there are also numerous groups of smartly-dressed
		#IF(game.getCurrentWeather()==WEATHER_MAGIC_STORM)

		#ENDIF
		 Enforcers loitering about the courtyard, with several more standing guard at each of the three main entrances. While the signs beside two of these doorways inform you that they're for Enforcer use only, the third bears the words
		#IF(game.getHourOfDay()>=9 && game.getHourOfDay()<=17)
			 'Public Inquiries; Reception open [style.colourMinorGood([units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)])]'. If you had any sort of business to conduct here, then this would be the door for you.
		#ELSE
			 'Public Inquiries; Reception open [style.colourMinorBad([units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)])]'. While the reception within may currently be [style.colourBad(closed)], you're still able to enter the building through this door.

As his body shifts into that of a girl, his face similarly transforms, and while you can still tell that it's Brax, his face is soon that of an attractive wolf-girl.

		#IF(brax.hasPenis())
			Bree lets out a soft whimper, and her hands suddenly dart down between her legs. While her large bulge doesn't diminish in size, her desperate squeals and pants let you know that her genitalia are transforming, and you grin as you realise that Bree now has the reproductive systems of both a wolf-boy and wolf-girl.
		#ELSE
			Bree lets out a soft whimper, and her hands suddenly dart down between her legs. Her large bulge quickly shrinks, and she squeals and pants as her genitalia are the next to take on a new form.

		#ENDIF
	</p>

		The final transformation to take place is located in Bree's chest, and you see her new breasts swelling up as she continues to writhe around on the floor. Panting, and totally exhausted from her transformation, the potion's effects come to an end, leaving Bree with C-cup breasts, girly hips, a large ass, and a pretty wolf-girl's face.
	</p>
	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(You're so cute, Bree!)] Candi cries out. [candi.speechNoEffects(I bet you, like, can't wait to try out your new body! Hey! How about your friend helps you out?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[brax.speech(Y-Yes Candi...)] Bree sighs, meekly looking up at you.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of the dominance and fiery spirit has gone from Bree's eyes, and she submissively kneels on the floor beneath you, awaiting your response. You could pull her into Candi's office and help her get used to her new body, or you could leave and come back to have some fun later.

		Bree allows Candi to push her down onto her chair, before obediently opening her mouth.

Gulping it down, Bree licks her lips as Candi pulls away from her, before letting out a little sigh.

		Bree starts shifting around uncomfortably in her seat, and, looking down, you see the cause of her discomfort. Her ass and hips are rapidly expanding, and with an audible tear, her Enforcer shorts split at the seams. Letting out a little cry, Bree clutches the fabric against her groin, trying to conceal herself as the next transformation starts to take place.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like her lower body, Bree's upper body starts to expand, and you watch, wide-eyed, as her breasts swell up. Her Enforcer uniform can't take the stress, and you watch as the buttons of her shirt ping off to reveal her massive breasts.

	<p>
		Before you have any time to comment on her new body and personality, Candi grabs her arm and pulls her into her office, shouting behind her, [candi.speechNoEffects(I'm gonna give Brandi some of my old clothes, give us five mins, then come have some fun with her!)]

		A fishnet top does nothing to conceal her massive KK-cup breasts, and you see that a tiny miniskirt isn't doing much better of a job downstairs. Candi must have a thing for fishnets, as she's given Brandi a pair of fishnet stocking, as well as gloves, finishing off her slutty appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most noticeable thing, however, is how Brandi's facial expression has changed. Her once-dominant-and-intimidating stare has shifted into a vacant, hungry gaze, and her eyes travel up the length of your body as she licks her lips.

Responding to her protestations with the simple demand that she produce the paperwork for signing over [brax.name], you soon manage to get her to do as you ask. Once the correct forms for a slave transfer are laid out before you, you allow Candi to take the lipsticks.

		#IF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_bimbofiedBrax))
			[brax.speechNoEffects(So, like, I'm getting you as my new owner?)] [brax.name] asks, biting her lip and batting her eyelids at you.
		#ELSEIF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_feminisedBrax))
			[brax.speechNoEffects(So... Y-You're going to be the one owning me now?)] [brax.name] asks, nervously shuffling her feet as she wonders how you're going to be treating her.
		#ELSE
			[brax.speechNoEffects(I can't believe this!)] [brax.name] exclaims, [brax.speech(<i>[pc.SheIs]</i> going to be my... my <i>owner</i>?! ~Eugh!~)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Responding in the affirmative, and telling [brax.name] to collect whatever personal possessions [brax.she] has, you then sign the papers laid out in front of you, before asking Candi to do the same. Despite all that you've done for her, she seems very reluctant to go through with it, and it takes some pointed reminders of her promises to finally get her to sign off on the transfer. Being infused with a special arcane enchantment, the documents immediately react to both party's signatures, and with a bright purple flash, the enslavement collar around [brax.namePos] neck activates, teleporting [brax.herHim] to the slaver administration building's holding cells.
	</p>
	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(Well, like, there ya go,)] candi pouts, clearly upset at having lost her slave, [candi.speechNoEffects(I guess these lipsticks are, like, pretty good, but I feel like you cheated me outta something!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not wanting an Enforcer with a grudge on your back, you remind Candi that you also retrieved her perfume, as well as the box of contraband lollipops, and that by all accounts it was a fair deal. As you mention this, her eyes suddenly light up, and she happily exclaims, [candi.speechNoEffects(Oh, that's right! I, like, forgot about those! I was saving them for when this happened to make me feel better!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can even think about stopping her, the bimbo cat-girl reaches down beneath her desk, and, producing a glowing-pink lollipop, she wraps her plump lips around it and starts sucking. Immediately, you see her cheeks flush red, and with complete indifference to your presence before her, she drops her hands down between her legs, before pulling her skirt up and reaching down into her thong to start masturbating. 
	</p>
	<p>
		[candi.speechNoEffects(Fuck, like, the<i>sh</i>e thing<i>sh</i> are pretty good,)] she slurps around the lollipop in her mouth, before looking up into your eyes and pleading, [candi.speechNoEffects(I'm <i>sh</i>o horny! Like, plea<i>sh</i>e! Come round here and fuck me!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With any animosity towards you seemingly forgotten, Candi continues desperately pleading for you to fuck her, and you wonder if you should take her up on her offer, or simply take your leave and see to the arrangements for your new slave...

		Connected to the adjoining corridor by a pair of wide, propped-open doors, the requisitions area is the place where specialist or replacement equipment can be checked out by the HQ's Enforcers. [pc.Stepping] through the open doors into this area, you find yourself standing in a relatively small room, which, other than a couple of basic metal tables pushed into each corner, is devoid of any furniture. The only other points of interest are the locked door and waist-high counter set into the wall before you.
