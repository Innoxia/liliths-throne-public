	<p>
		The wide, red-carpeted staircase behind you leads down to the ground floor of Zaranix's house.
		 To either side of you, a corridor leads off into other parts of the building, and you wonder which way you should go...
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="CORRIDOR"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Much like those found on the ground floor, these corridors are home to numerous fine paintings, cushioned chairs, and well-crafted cabinets.
		 Where once you might have been deeply impressed by the extravagant luxury of this incubus's mansion, you now find yourself thinking that it's not quite as grand as Lilaya's.

	<htmlContent tag="KELLY_PRESENT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		As you walk down the corridor, an ivory-skinned succubus, wearing a light pink maid's uniform, suddenly stands up from behind a cabinet.
		 She doesn't notice you at first, and continues to swipe her little feather-duster over the top of the wooden furniture, happily humming away as she works.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you have a chance to say anything, she looks up and catches sight of you.
		 Letting out a little cry, she curtsies as she greets you.
		 [kelly.speech(Ah! [pc.Miss] [pc.name]! Mistress Amber informed me of your visit. I'm Kelly, at your service!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As the maid stands up, you see her lustful gaze roaming up and down your body.
		 Biting her lip, she steps towards you, and with more than a little lust in her voice, she moans,
		 [kelly.speech(If there's <i>anything</i> I can do for you, just let me know.
		 Master Zaranix only has time for Amber these days... N-Not that I'm complaining, but... Well... My sister and I get lonely, you understand...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Kelly giggles, and, as she bats her eyelids at you, drops the little feather duster that she's holding.
		 [kelly.speech(Oops!)]
		 She cries, pretending that it was by accident.
		 Bending over right in front of you, she makes a show of flashing her crotchless pink thong in your direction, granting you an unobstructed view of her [kelly.pussy+].
		 Obviously desperate for you to fuck her, you wonder if you should make a move on this horny maid...

	<htmlContent tag="KELLY_PRESENT_REPEAT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Up ahead, you see the ivory-skinned maid, Kelly, busily dusting one of the corridor's picture frames.
		 As you approach, you see that the maid glances at you out of the corner of her eye.
		 Instead of turning and acknowledging your presence, however, Kelly pretends not to have seen you, and suddenly bends over to dust the skirting board.
		 The horny maid makes a show of flashing her crotchless pink thong in your direction, granting you an unobstructed view of her [kelly.pussy+].
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning her head to look back at you, Kelly lets out a little cry as she rather-unconvincingly pretends to have only just noticed you.
		 Standing up to face you, she curtsies and bites her lip to suppress a needy moan.
		 [kelly.speech([pc.Miss] [pc.name]! How pleasant to see you again! If there's <i>anything</i> I can help you with, just let me know!)]
	</p>

		Deciding to take up Kelly's transparent offer of sex, you step forwards, grinning as you let your gaze wander up and down over the maid's perfect body.
		 [pc.speech(Well, there is one thing that a horny little succubus like you could do for me.)]
		 
	</p>
	<p>
		Kelly lets out an excited squeal as she gazes into your eyes, and you see them filled with a desperate, burning lust.
		 Bounding forwards, she suddenly wraps her arms around your back, and with a desperate moan, presses her [kelly.lips+] against yours.
		 You reciprocate the gesture, and after spending a few moments sliding your tongues into one another's mouths, you pull back, grinning...

		 [pc.speech(Kelly... Erm... If you're feeling a little horny, perhaps you could use me? I mean, I-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Kelly lets out an excited squeal, interrupting your sentence as she bounds forwards and wraps her arms around your back.
		 With a desperate moan, she quickly presses her [kelly.lips+] against yours.
		 You reciprocate the gesture, but only spend a few moments sliding your tongues into one another's mouths before Kelly pulls back, moaning.
		 [kelly.speech(Oh yes! Fuck... I'm so fucking horny! I <i>need</i> you!)]

	<htmlContent tag="KELLY_SEX_DECLINED"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You're not really interested in Kelly's transparent offer of sex right now.
		 [pc.speech(Thank you Kelly, but there's nothing I need from you at the moment.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[kelly.speech(Aww! Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me!)]
		 Kelly smiles, before turning away and continuing with her work.

	<p>
		Kelly lets out a deeply-satisfied sigh as you pull away from her.
		 [kelly.speech(~Aaah!~ Fuck... That was great!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you gather your things and prepare to move on, Kelly slumps back against the nearest wall, her hand slipping down between her legs as she slowly strokes herself.
		 [kelly.speech(~Mmm!~ That was so good...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Deciding to leave Kelly to bask in her post-sex afterglow, you turn around and continue down the corridor.

		As you gather your things and prepare to move on, Kelly slumps back against the nearest wall, her hand slipping down between her legs as she seeks to finish herself off.
		 [kelly.speech(Y-You carry on... ~Mmm!~ This won't take me long... ~Aaah!~)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Doing as the unsatisfied maid suggests, you turn around and continue down the corridor.

	<htmlContent tag="ROOM"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The door to this room is locked, and there's no sound of anyone within.
		 Knowing that it's sure to just be a dull and uninteresting dead-end, you decide against trying to force the door open, and turn around to continue on your way through Zaranix's home.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="ZARANIX_ROOM_OUTSIDE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The door to Zaranix's room is slightly ajar, and from within, you can hear the bubbling of potions and clink of glass vials as the master of the house carries out his experiments.
		 There's nothing stopping you from knocking on the door and stepping inside, but, if you didn't want to speak to Zaranix right now, you could always step back and return another time.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="ZARANIX_ROOM_EXIT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You decide to take your leave, and, smiling at Zaranix, you step back.
		 [pc.speech(I'd better get going now. It was good talking to you again, Zaranix.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Likewise.)]
		 The imposing incubus states, grinning back at you.
		 [zaranix.speech(Do please visit again! Oh, and if you could, put in a good word with Lilaya about me, hmm?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I will.)]
		 You say, heading towards the door.
		 [pc.speech(Bye!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Goodbye! Oh, and don't let Amber be too harsh on you, ok?)]
		 Zaranix waves, before turning his back on you and returning to his experiments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pushing open the bedroom door, you step back outside into the corridor, wondering where to go next...

	<htmlContent tag="ZARANIX_ROOM_ENTER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding to pay Zaranix another visit, you raise your hand and deliver a short rap on the bedroom door.
		 [zaranix.speech(Enter.)]
		 The incubus calls out from within his room, and, following his command, you push open the door and step forwards. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Well-lit by several ceiling-mounted, arcane-powered lights, and with a series of large windows set into the opposite wall, the spacious room that you find yourself stepping into is particularly well-illuminated.
		 Numerous bookcases and shelves line the walls to either side of you, and within the main body of the room itself, a number of long tables are being used to hold piles of books, racks of glass bottles, and boxes full of all sorts of raw alchemical ingredients.
		 As you enter, you find yourself thinking that this room looks very much like a small-scale version of Lilaya's laboratory.
	</p>
	<p>
		There, in the middle of the room, holding a beaker filled with a strange, bubbling green liquid, is the purple-skinned figure of the incubus Zaranix.
		 As he sees that it's you, he places the beaker down on the table beside him and grins.
		 [zaranix.speech(Well, well, well! Look who it is!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Hello again, Zaranix. Amber told me that you'd instructed her to let me in. There's no hard feelings between us then?)]
		 You ask, looking around for any sign of a trap.
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Not at all!)]
		 Zaranix booms, before stepping forwards, grabbing your [pc.hand], and giving it a firm shake.
		 [zaranix.speech(I couldn't harbour any ill will towards one of Lilaya's relatives!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Well, that's good to hear.)]
		 You say, smiling at the friendly incubus as he finally releases your [pc.hand].

	<p>
		[pc.speech(I was wondering how you came by these maids of yours. Kelly and Katherine are sisters, right? And I'm surprised that someone as... dominant... as Amber chooses to work as a maid. What's her story?)]
		 You ask, curious about Zaranix's household.
	</p>
	<p>
		Collapsing down onto a nearby chair, Zaranix grins as he starts to tell you the story.
		 [zaranix.speech(Well, as you know, I haven't been recognised by my Lilin mother, so, unable to rely on her support, I decided early on in my life to focus on making and selling transformative potions.
		 It didn't take me long to find success. After all, it's only us demons who are really able to harness the arcane well enough to make such potions.)]
		 Zaranix smiles as he remembers the events in his past.
		 [zaranix.speech(As demand for my potions increased, so too did the amount of time that I had to spend on making them.
		 The house that I was renting at that time soon fell into a appalling state of affairs, and I realised that I was going to need to hire a maid.
		 Little did I know that I was going to end up with my little inferno!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You grin as you hear Zaranix's affectionate name for Amber.
		 [pc.speech(So you hired Amber before the sisters?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(That's right!)]
		 Zaranix booms.
		 [zaranix.speech(I went to a local agency, and, not really knowing what I was doing, I signed a contract to hire the first maid that they offered me.
		 Little did I know that I'd just been scammed!
		 I tell you, when I answered the door to Amber the next day, I was sure that there had been some sort of mistake!
		 The very instant that I met her, she started scolding me, insulting me, and forcing me to help her clean the house!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(That sounds like her.)]
		 You say, smiling as you imagine that first day's interaction between Amber and Zaranix.
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Yes, well, I put up with it for that first day, intent on firing her after she left.
		 You can imagine my surprise when Amber informed me, just after making me prepare her some dinner, that she wasn't going home, and that she now lived with me!
		 I immediately ran down to the agency, just in time to catch them before they closed for the evening.
		 That's when I found out that the contract I signed bound me to hire Amber for no less than five years!
		 Defeated, I went back home to suffer a severe scolding from my new maid...)]
		 A deep, booming laugh bursts out of Zaranix's mouth as he recollects his experience.
		 [zaranix.speech(After that, however, things started to get better.
		 Over the next few weeks and months, Amber's fiery temper started to cool, and she eventually began to act like a proper maid, even so far as to start calling me 'master'.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(And Kelly and Katherine?)]
		 You inquire.
		 [pc.speech(When did you hire them?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Ah, that was after I moved into this house here.
		 Amber told me that this place was too large for her to keep clean alone, so I sent her to hire a couple more maids.
		 Kelly and Katherine were her choices, not mine.)]
		 Zaranix says, smiling.
		 [zaranix.speech(Apparently, they've only ever worked as a pair, and had caused quite a bit of trouble in their previous posts.
		 Thanks to that, they were considerably cheaper than similarly-experienced maids, and their troublesome ways were soon dealt with by Amber. Hah!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Coming to the end of his long story, Zaranix stands up, before smiling at you in his friendly manner.

		[zaranix.speech(That's right!)]
		 Zaranix booms, gesturing to the room around you with an open palm.
		 [zaranix.speech(This entire setup was created with that goal in mind.

		 No, the only ways someone becomes a demon is through being born as one, or transformed into one by a Lilin's arcane power.)]

		 Zaranix sighs.
		 [zaranix.speech(I'm mainly trying to improve the efficiency of my alchemical processes.

		Sensing the incoming question, Zaranix chuckles as he cuts you short.
		 [zaranix.speech(Why do I choose to stay as an incubus?
