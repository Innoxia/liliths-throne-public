		Keen to put an end to your lengthy pursuit of Arthur, you once again find yourself travelling through the district of Dominion known as 'Demon Home'. Following the directions that you received from Scarlett, you soon locate Zaranix's house, which lies only a couple of streets away from your elusive quarry's apartment building. With a wry grin, you take a moment to reflect on the fact that Arthur was right under your nose this whole time, before focusing your attention on the building in front of you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much like all the other buildings in this area of the city, Zaranix's home takes the form of a grand, regency-style town-house. Unlike the majority of the other buildings, however, his home has what appears to be a modestly sized private garden adjoining the property to the right-hand side. A cast-iron fence, standing at around [units.size(250)], separates the garden from the street in which you're standing, but despite its height, you're sure that you could climb over it if you wanted to try and sneak inside.

		Once more you find yourself standing outside Zaranix's home. Much like all the other buildings in this area of the city, the incubus's residence takes the form of a grand, regency-style town-house. Unlike the majority of the surrounding buildings, however, there's a modestly sized private garden adjoined to the right-hand side of the property.

		You decide that the most appropriate course of action is to simply knock on the door and ask to see Arthur. Stepping forwards, you take hold of the ornate brass door knocker and deliver a sharp rap to alert those inside of your presence.
	</p>
	<p>
		After just a few moments, you hear the sound of a lock being slid back, before the heavy oak door swings inwards to reveal one of the most striking succubi you've ever seen. Her gorgeous face and perfectly proportioned body are covered in pitch-black ebony skin, but it's not her voluptuous figure which your eyes are drawn to. Styled into loose waves, and giving off a luminescent, yellowy-orange glow, it's her extraordinary amber hair, which reaches down to just above her ass, that you find yourself gazing at. As her eyes fixate themselves onto yours, you see that her irises are the exact same glowing-amber shade as her hair, giving this demon a truly remarkable appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the fact that her maid's dress quite clearly identifies her as a servant in this household, her attitude is not at all one of subservience, and as she crosses her arms and leans against the door frame, she makes a disapproving clicking noise with her tongue, [amber.speech(Who are <i>you</i> supposed to be? We're not expecting any visitors, and you're wasting my valuable time, so this had better be good!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You're pretty sure that servants aren't ordinarily supposed to greet visitors like that, but this particular maid doesn't exactly seem to be ordinary. As her tail swishes from side to side with impatience, she narrows her piercing, luminescent-amber eyes and glares at you in an intimidating manner.

		Doing the first thing that comes to your mind, you drop down onto your knees and look up at the inhospitable maid. The amber glow of her hair and eyes seems to grow even fiercer as her face contorts into one of rage, but before she can open her mouth, you blurt out an apology, [pc.speech(I'm sorry for wasting your time! Please, <i>please</i> can I see Arthur? I've been searching for him for forever! Please!)]

		The demon's voice takes on a different tone as she steps forwards, [amber.speech(I <i>do</i> deserve to have a little fun though. I'll let you see my master, who'll then decide if you can meet with Arthur or not, but you'll have to show me that you're prepared to be on your best behaviour.

		Still looking up at the sadistic maid, you see a wicked snarl break out across her face. She snaps her fingers at you and points to her feet, clearly serious about the demand that she's making. It's not too late to stand up and take your leave, but if you wanted to see Arthur without resorting to a more clandestine or violent approach, it looks like you'll have to do as the succubus asks.

		After that brief encounter, you follow Amber a little further down the corridor, before turning off and being led through a heavy oaken door into a grand drawing room. Several sofas and chairs are tastefully arranged around a low table in the centre of the room, while numerous bookcases and cabinets line the floral-wallpapered walls. The high ceiling is home to yet another extravagant chandelier, and you suddenly feel very small as you

	</p>
	<p>
		Doing as you're told, your remain in place, the two of you waiting in silence as you anticipate the arrival of Zaranix. Afforded a moment in which to take a closer look at Amber, you glance over in her direction. Her luminescent hair and eyes are quite obviously the features from which she gets her name, and combined with her almost pitch-black ebony skin, you find yourself comparing her appearance to that of a volcano; an image all the more appropriate considering her fiery personality.
	</p>
	<p>
		Obviously hearing her master's approach, she suddenly leans forwards and opens the door. As the maid steps aside, the figure of Zaranix strides forwards into the room. Standing at well over [units.size(183)], well dressed in a grey shirt and smart trousers, and with a broad chest and purple-skinned, muscular body, the incubus cuts an impressive figure. He strides over towards the sofa opposite to where you're sitting, and, clearly having missed you at first, he does a double-take as he catches sight of you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Hah!)] he cries, not at all in a mean-spirited manner, but in one more of mild surprise. [zaranix.speech(I'll wager this is Amber's doing! Well, if you're comfortable down there, no need to move!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The huge incubus bounds over to the sofa and collapses down onto it, before throwing you such a disarmingly friendly smile that you suddenly find yourself a little flustered. You were half-expecting Amber's master to be just as harsh as she is, but, much to your surprise, Zaranix seems to be the complete opposite, and cheerily booms, [zaranix.speech(Anyone who manages to get past my little inferno over there is worth every moment of my time!

	</p>
	<p>
		She suddenly cuts her sentence off and freezes mid-stride. Her luminescent hair and eyes still burning with the same fury as that of her volcanic personality, Amber throws one last scowl your way before turning around and rushing over to the door through which you entered.
	</p>
	<p>
		Obviously having heard her master's approach, she leans forwards and opens the door just in time to allow the figure of Zaranix to stride forwards into the room. Standing at well over [units.size(183)], well dressed in a grey shirt and smart trousers, and with a broad chest and purple-skinned, muscular body, the incubus cuts an impressive figure.

	<p>
		[pc.speech(Would you at least be willing to talk to my aunt Lilaya about this?)] you ask, desperate for this not to be the end of your quest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Zaranix had started to stand up, but as you ask that question, he immediately sits back down, and you see a flash of concern pass over his handsome face. [zaranix.speech(She's called Lilaya? It's a dangerous game, naming yourself after a Lilin's favourite child like that. You should advise your aunt to change it, before it brings down Lyssieth's wrath.)]
	</p>

		[pc.speech(Erm, that <i>is</i> my aunt,)] you explain. [pc.speech(She used to work with Arthur, and now she needs his help again. I've been trying to track him down for her for quite a while now...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Hah!)] Zaranix laughs again, but you notice that his cry sounds rather more deflated than before. [zaranix.speech(So your aunt's Lilaya herself, huh? I suppose <i>you're</i> the [pc.race] who's living with her? Yes, I've heard all about you. I may not get out much, but I still keep my ear close to the grapevine.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With a deep sigh, Zaranix stands up and calls out to Amber, [zaranix.speech(Bring Arthur down here would you, Amber?)]

		You go on to explain everything that's happened to you up until this point, noticing that Zaranix's cheery expression fades away more and more each time you mention anything to do with Lilaya. After a short while you come to the end of your tale, and after telling the incubus how you managed to find out where Arthur was from Scarlett, you bring your story to an end, [pc.speech(And so if I could buy Arthur from you, both my aunt and I would be extremely grateful.

	</p>
	<p>
		As you look over to the door, you can't help but let out a gasp.
		 This world's version of Arthur looks <i>exactly</i> the same as the one you used to know.
		 His lanky, pale-skinned body, his bright blue eyes, and his mop of messy, dark-brown hair are all exactly as you remember them.
		 In fact, the only difference between this Arthur and the one from your world appears to be in his choice of clothing.
		 Instead of his usual tweed suit, this Arthur is wearing a lab coat and a pair of safety goggles, revealing the fact that, just like Lilaya, he's not a historian in this world, but an arcane researcher.
	</p>
	<p>
		[arthur.speech(Well, here I am, summoned at your convenience! And, I might add, not at all to mine! How am I ever going to prove to you that demonic transformation potions are impossible to make if I'm going to be interrupted on a whim?!)]
		 Arthur exclaims, very much in tone that would never suggest he was Zaranix's slave.
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(You won't need to trouble yourself with proving that to me anymore,)]
		 Zaranix replies.
		 [zaranix.speech(If truth be told, you'd already convinced me that it wasn't going to happen after your first day here.
		 It's a moot point now anyway. Apparently, Lilaya wants you back. So go on, you're free. Oh, and you have [pc.name] here to thank for tracking you down.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[arthur.speech(Bloody hell! And here I was, all ready to resign myself to a life of misery and servitude. But if it's <i>Lilaya</i> who's after me, then maybe the life of a slave doesn't sound so bad after all...)]
		 Arthur looks across at you and smiles.
		 [arthur.speech(If she doesn't blast me to pieces the moment she sees me, then I'll owe you my thanks for my freedom.
			 I suppose I'll see you over at her place; I wouldn't want to overstay my welcome here, so I'd best be on my way!
			 Thank you Zaranix for a delightful stay, and, my dear Amber, do try to allow yourself to smile now and again!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Arthur turns about and practically skips away through the door, promising the momentarily flustered Amber that he'll show himself out as he makes his exit.
	</p>
	<p>
		[amber.speech(That insolent-)] Amber starts, but is quickly cut off by her master.
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Let him go, Amber, it's not worth getting caught up in the affairs of Lyssieth's favourite child.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[amber.speech(Yes, master,)] Amber replies, before turning her attention towards you,
		 [amber.speech(but <i>this one</i> should at least show [pc.her] gratitude.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[zaranix.speech(Well, I can't really demand anything of someone so close to a demon as important as Lilaya, but I <i>did</i> go though a lot of trouble to get hold of Arthur...)]

		You obediently crawl alongside Amber as she leads you between Zaranix's legs, and with one last push, forces your head down into his crotch.

You can't help but let out a little whine as you suddenly find your face just [unit.sizes] away from Zaranix's huge, purple demon-cock.

	<p>
		Before you have the chance to take any action, one of the most striking succubi you've ever seen, who you assume to be 'Mistress Amber', enters the hall.
		 Her gorgeous face and perfectly proportioned body are covered in pitch-black ebony skin, but it's not her voluptuous figure which your eyes are drawn to.
		 Styled into loose waves, and giving off a luminescent, yellowy-orange glow, it's her extraordinary amber hair, which reaches down to just above her ass, that you find yourself gazing at.
		 As her eyes fixate themselves onto yours, you see that her irises are the exact same glowing-amber shade as her hair, giving this demon a truly remarkable appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the fact that her maid's dress quite clearly identifies her as a servant in this household, her attitude is not at all one of subservience, and as she sees you standing inside her master's home, she screams,
		 [amber.speech(You picked the wrong house to try and rob, bitch!)]

		The entrance hall to Zaranix's home, while nothing compared to that of Lilaya's, is nonetheless very impressive.
		 A huge crystal chandelier casts its bright, arcane-powered light over the entire area, and fine paintings in golden frames hang on each of the surrounding walls.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main door to Zaranix's home is made from thick, sturdy oak, and there's nothing stopping you from opening it and taking your leave.
		 <b>It looks like the door will be locked behind you if you do this, so be prepared to gain entry all over again if you choose to leave now!</b>

	</p>
	<p>
		Much like the rest of the house, the walls surrounding you are home to several fine paintings.
		 Well-crafted cabinets, cushioned chairs, and little wooden tables are strategically dotted about here and there, but not so much so as to make the area seem cluttered.
	</p>
	<p>
		You could use the stairs here to gain access to the first floor, which is where you're sure to find Zaranix.

		You find yourself comparing the corridors of Zaranix's home to those of Lilaya's. While they're just as well-furnished as those of your aunt's house, being home to numerous fine paintings, cushioned chairs, and well-crafted cabinets, they're not quite as wide nor high. Where once you might have been deeply impressed by the extravagant luxury of this incubus's mansion, you now find yourself thinking that it's not quite as grand as the one you live in.

		A gravel path snakes through the entirety of Zaranix's garden, but, finding that the stones crunch loudly underfoot, you opt to walk on the small grass verge instead so as to remain as quiet as possible.
		 To either side of the path, numerous flowerbeds and small glass structures are home to an incredible variety of plant-life, much of which is quite clearly alien to your old world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although small enough not to pose a threat, you see several, tentacle-like varieties squirming and twisting about with a mind of their own; the brightly coloured flower in the centre of each one looking unmistakably like a vagina.
		 Inspecting yet more of the flora as you move along, you notice that some of these tentacled plants have penis-like endings,
			 and you spend a moment reflecting on the fact that even the plant-life in this world is sexual in nature.
		 From the variety of herbs, plants, and flowers, and the evidence of careful cultivation techniques, it appears as though this garden is less for show, and more for the practical purpose of gathering arcane ingredients.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking over towards the side of Zaranix's house, you see a couple of glass doors connecting a pair of rooms to the garden in which you find yourself standing.
		 You could either make your way over to them and use them to gain entry to the house, or climb back over the fence and return to the street behind you.
