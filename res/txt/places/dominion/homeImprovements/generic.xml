		Set back from one of the main streets, and with Dominion's canal running close behind it, there's an expansive lumber yard, with a couple of large warehouses sitting in the middle of it. An impressive wrought-iron sign over the entrance to this area declares it be 'Argus's DIY Depot', while smaller, wooden signs attached to the supporting posts reveal that the warehouses are open from 
		#IF(game.isExtendedWorkTime())
			 [style.colourMinorGood([units.time(6)]-[units.time(22)])].
		#ELSE
			 [style.colourMinorBad([units.time(6)]-[units.time(22)])].
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking across at the warehouses, you see that one is quite clearly signposted as being open to the general public, while the other is apparently just for supplying small businesses. Huge posters advertising cans of paint, ceramic tiles, tools, timber, and all manner of miscellaneous building supplies have been plastered all over the walls of these warehouses, letting passersby know the sort of things which can be purchased here.
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(game.getCurrentWeather()==WEATHER_MAGIC_STORM)
			As there's an arcane storm raging overhead, your surroundings are almost completely deserted, with only the occasional demon to be seen walking down the nearby street.
			#IF(game.isExtendedWorkTime())
				 As the warehouses are [style.colourGood(currently open)], you wonder how many people are inside due to legitimate business, and how many are just making use of the building to take shelter from the storm. If you wanted to, you could always head inside the one signposted as being open to the public and do some shopping for DIY or building supplies.
			#ELSE
				 Unfortunately, due to the time of day, the warehouses are [style.colourBad(currently closed)], so if you wanted to do any shopping for DIY or building supplies, you'll have to return at a more sociable hour.

	<htmlContent tag="ENTRANCE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The first thing anyone notices upon entering this warehouse is the large, colourful sign hanging from its high ceiling, which bears the exclamation, '<i>Welcome to Argus's DIY Depot!</i>'
	</p>
	<p>
		In stark contrast to this cheery message, the rest of the scene which greets new customers is a distinctly boring one, consisting of a series of a dozen or so checkouts, several rows of trolleys, and a rather uninspired collection of ordinary garden plants. Taking a brief look around, you notice that less than half of these checkouts are currently staffed, which is causing a small queue of customers to build up at each one. In addition to the employees working behind these tills, there's a solitary security guard standing watch near the front doors, who seems to be doing little else but casting suspicious glances at everyone who walks past him.

	<p>
		The interior of 'Argus's DIY Depot' is just as dull to the casual shopper as one would expect. Drab, grey concrete flooring perfectly matches the monotone steel roof high up ahead, while the goods stacked up on the tall shelves would be best described as being distinctly unremarkable. From boxes of screws to flooring tiles, arcane light bulbs to stacks of wooden planks, there really isn't anything here that threatens to hold your interest for more than a fraction of a second.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you continue forwards, your progress is regularly impeded by groups of slow-moving shoppers, and occasionally also by the odd shopping trolley inconsiderately positioned so as to be blocking half of the aisle. All of this, combined with the unbearably repetitive background music being piped through the store's loudspeakers, makes you think that prolonged exposure to this environment would surely be enough to drive anybody completely insane.

		Informative signs are helpfully positioned throughout the warehouse, and after consulting the nearest one, you discover that the 'Premium-grade Supplies' are kept near the front entrance. This would undoubtedly be the place to go if you were intending to buy the 'Purple-star' paint which Helena specified. Then again, if you wanted to save some money, and are prepared to run the risk of annoying Helena, you could head over to the sides of the warehouse, where the 'Standard-grade Supplies' are marked as being kept...

		Although its frosted glass windows run along the entire front length of the warehouse, the manager's office seems to have only the one entrance, which takes the form of the wooden door that you're currently standing in front of.
