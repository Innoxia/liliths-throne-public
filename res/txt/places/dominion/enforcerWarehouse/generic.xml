		Doing as Claire asks, you kneel down and start looking over the side of the teleportation pad's base. Sure enough, after just a moment spent searching for it, you spot the round hatch which Claire is after, and draw her attention to it, [pc.speech(I think I've found that 'essence port' you're looking for.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Rushing over to kneel down beside you, the short cat-girl lets out a deep sigh of relief, [claire.speech(Thank goodness! I always carry a couple of spare essence cells with me, so once I've inserted one, this pad should activate again and we can get out of here!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Opening the round hatch, your Enforcer companion then reaches into a pocket on her armoured vest. Obviously finding it empty, she lets out a little huff, before checking the pocket beside it. Finding that one empty too, she starts frantically patting down and searching every pocket and pouch on her uniform. Finding each one as empty as the last, her breathing starts getting heavier and heavier, until finally she lets out a wail of despair. Allowing her hands to drop down onto her thick thighs, she sinks down onto her large, rounded ass and cries, [claire.speech(This can't be happening! We're going to be in so much trouble! I-I might even lose my job... Or even get arrested! What if they enslave us?! I don't want to be a sex slave! These SWORD guys aren't like regular Enforcers; they're trigger-happy maniacs!

	<p>
		Along with the other two still sitting in the gap, this shelving unit looks to be full of nothing more than dusty old accounting books. As you and Claire start to move through the opening you've just created, however, you see a book lying on the floor which is very unlike all these others. Instantly recognising it as a spell book, you bend down to pick it up, and feel your eyes widening in surprise as you see that it contains detailed instructions on how to cast the very spell which got you into this whole mess; 'teleport'.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Hey, what's that you've found? It must have fallen out of the shelf as it was moving,)] Claire says, stepping up beside you. As she sees what it is, the tone of her voice instantly changes from one of curiosity to one of alarm, and she hisses, [claire.speech(A teleport spell book?! Y-You can't take that! What are you doing?! That's a forbidden spell; only lilin or the highest-ranking Enforcers are allowed those!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(But if I can quickly learn it, maybe I'd be able to teleport back to your Enforcer post and pick up one of those essence cells, and then come back to save you,)] you suggest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Torn between her duty as an Enforcer and the prospect of escaping this whole mess the two of you are in, the little cat-girl paces back and forth for a moment before turning towards you and letting out a defeated sigh. Placing her hands on her wide hips, she pouts at you as she says, [claire.speech(Fine... Just don't you <i>ever</i> tell <i>anyone</i> that I allowed you to do this... A-And anyway, you haven't broken the law until you attempt to learn that spell, so if I don't see you doing it, then I'm not responsible for having to arrest you!)]
	</p>

		Having found a solution to her moral dilemma, Claire turns her back on you, before hissing over her shoulder for you to hurry up. Not wanting to point out the flaws in Claire's logic, you turn your attention back to the book still in your hands...

As the light fades, you discover that you're still standing in exactly the same place as you were a moment ago.

		[claire.speech(I should have known there'd be a teleport inhibition device in here...)] Claire sighs as she sees that your spell failed.

		Just like the rest of the warehouse that you've seen so far, the path which you find yourself looking down is flanked on both sides by towering stacks of wooden crates. What's different about the scene before you, however, is that there's [npc.a_race] Enforcer standing guard about [unit.lSize(2000)] away from you. Thankfully, [npc.sheIs] currently preoccupied with throwing darts into the side of a nearby crate, and hasn't noticed either you or Claire, who has snuck up behind you and joined you in peeking around the corner.

Although [npc.sheIs] no threat at the moment, due to being concerned only with trying to score a bullseye on her makeshift dartboard, you imagine that [npc.she]'d be a very dangerous opponent if you were to drawn into a fight with [npc.herHim].

		Immediately picking up on what it is you mean by that, the busty little cat-girl practically jumps with excitement as she rushes forwards and grabs you by the [pc.hand].

	</p>
	<p>
		Although Claire would probably object, there's nothing really stopping you from walking up to this curious crate and taking a look inside. Perhaps it contains some sort of powerful artefact which would help the two of you to escape?

		Solid red lines have been marked out on the floor of this particular part of the warehouse, and within the area which they encompass, you see that the words 'Restricted Area' have been spray-painted in regular intervals. The crate marked as 'Top Secret', which contained the arcane lightning globe, is sitting in the middle of this forbidden zone, and as you were careful to leave it exactly as you found it, you don't think that whoever carts it off into storage will discover that its contents are missing...

	<p>
		There's no way that you're not going to take the opportunity to search through a 'Top Secret' crate locked away in a guarded warehouse like this. Stepping forwards over the solid red line that's painted on the floor, you enter the 'Restricted Area' and head directly over to this curious container.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(What are you doing?)] Claire hisses, before puffing up her chest, placing her hands on her hips, and continuing to scold you, [claire.speech(Can't you read?! That's a restricted area!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Having already expected this response, you turn to face the pouting cat-girl and explain, [pc.speech(This might just contain something that can get us out of here. You do want to escape from here, right?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Of course I do!)] she responds, marching forwards beside you so that she can continue objecting without having to shout, [claire.speech(I also don't want to be charged with entering a restricted area and looting some top secret crate! Anyway, we don't have time to argue; just do what you've got to do and then let's get going!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(It'll be faster if you help,)] you say, stepping up to the crate and starting to pull open the lid.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Oh, fine!)] she replies, grabbing the other end of the lid and helping you to lift it up and off the top of the crate.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the container now open, the two of you step forwards and peer inside. Rather disappointingly, all you see are stacks of brown paper folders, each one stamped with 'Top Secret' in big red lettering. Your companion, however, notices something more to the crate's contents, and, pushing some of these folders out of the way, she reveals a small metal box sitting beside a dozen or so bottles of swirling arcane essence. Reaching inside, the curious cat-girl retrieves the metal box, before turning it over in her hands and making a puzzled expression.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(I wonder what's in here,)] she muses, her objections of a moment ago quickly forgotten as she's overcome by curiosity. Before you can say or do anything to stop her, she unfastens the box's latch, before quickly opening the hinged lid and retrieving what's stored inside. As she brings it up to her face to take a closer look, you see that the mysterious object that she's holding is a small, crystal globe, no larger than a golf ball. Suspended in the very centre of it, there's a faint ball of glowing white light, but other than that, there doesn't seem to be anything particularly spectacular or dangerous about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Is this all there is?)] the cat-girl asks, [claire.speech(It looks like some kind of arcane Yule decoration or something. What's so top secret about- Eek!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Claire's question is interrupted as the small globe suddenly bursts into life in a spectacular fashion. One moment containing nothing but a seemingly-inert ball of arcane light, a split second later it's filled with dancing streaks of bright purple arcane lightning. While these arcing flashes look to be safely contained within the globe, their sudden appearance is nevertheless enough to make Claire jump, and in her panic, she throws it back into the wooden crate with considerable force. Unfortunately, this throw manages to directly strike the bottles of arcane essence stored within the box, and as several of them smash into pieces, a huge flash of purple-hued lightning is discharged from the little crystal globe.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Eek!)] Claire cries, dropping down into a crouch and shielding her head from the burst of energy. Of course, such a reaction does nothing to shield the cat-girl from the arcane lightning, and, similarly, there's nothing you can do to protect yourself from it either. Like a more focused version of a naturally-occurring arcane storm, this energy discharge doesn't cause any physical harm, but instead, you feel yourself starting to get aroused.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, this lightning discharge only lasts for a moment, and it rapidly dissipates before you're affected too strongly by its effects. Claire, on the other hand, seems to have been hit by a much stronger burst, and with a horny whine, she drops one hand down into her trousers and starts touching herself...

	<p>
		Concerned with how Claire has suddenly been affected by the arcane lightning, you step forwards and ask her if she's ok. As though woken from a dream, she seems to suddenly become aware of what she's doing, and, pulling her hand out of her trousers, she blushes and stammers, [claire.speech(Y-Yes, I-I'm fine! That lightning's just... Well... You can see how it's made me feel!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can suggest a solution to her problem, she pushes herself away from the crate and takes a deep breath. Assuming her favourite pose, she places her hands on her wide hips and states, [claire.speech(I-I can control myself! Come on, we need to get out of here!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		From the way she's starting hungrily at your body, combined with her blushing cheeks and the little whimpering moans she starts to make, you can tell that it's taking everything Claire's got to keep her lust under control. Satisfied that she's not going to do anything crazy that would alert the SWORD guards to your presence, you shift your attention back to the crate, and the curious globe that's sitting inside of it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Miraculously, despite having shattered a half-dozen or so vials of arcane essence, the lightning globe doesn't seem to have even the slightest scratch upon it, and what's more, it seems to have reverted to its inactive state, and once again contains just a seemingly-inert ball of white arcane light. Reaching inside the box, you pick up the small, golf-ball-sized globe, and as you lift it up to take a closer look at it, purple flashes of arcane lightning once again start streaking out from the central core.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(I-Is that thing safe to touch?)] Claire asks, her voice still a little shaky as she desperately tries to keep her lust under control. 
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Yes, I don't think it's going to discharge again without having some kind of arcane energy channelled into it,)] you reply, your natural affinity for the arcane instincively telling you that this is the case. Deciding to take this lightning globe with you, you tell your cat-girl companion, [pc.speech(Perhaps it will be useful in helping us to escape from this place.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking back into the crate, you see that a few of the bottled essences are still intact.
		#IF(!pc.hasQuest(QUEST_LINE_SIDE_ENCHANTMENT_DISCOVERY))
			 You get the feeling that if you were to open them, you'd be able to absorb the energy contained within, and could then channel that energy into the lightning globe in order to shoot a single bolt at a target.
		#ELSE
			 You get the feeling that arcane essences must be used as some sort of ammunition for this curious weapon, and that by channelling them into the lightning globe, you'd be able to shoot a single bolt at a target.
		#ENDIF
		 Picking them up, you add them to your inventory, then, after firmly closing the lid of the crate, you turn back towards Claire and tell her that the two of you should continue on your way.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(~Mmm!~)] she whines, and you see that one of her hands has found its way back down the front of her trousers again, while the other is busily groping her huge breasts. Suddenly becoming aware of what it is she's doing, she quickly stops playing with herself, and with her cheeks flushing bright red, she insists, [claire.speech(I-I'll be fine! I can control myself! Let's just get out of here!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		While you're convinced that she will indeed be able to control herself, you get the feeling that it wouldn't take much to convince her to have sex with you...

Pulling it out, you discover that it's a spell book containing details on how to cast 'Telepathic Communication'.

Knowing that you'll probably have an opportunity to get your [pc.hands] on some of this SWORD gear another time in the future, and with Claire hot on your heels, you make your way over towards the huge warehouse doors that the SWORD Enforcers were guarding. Just beside this large industrial entranceway, there's a smaller, regular-sized door, and it's this exit which you and your cat-girl companion quickly approach. Eager to finally get out of this place, you hurriedly unlock the door, before pushing it open and making good your escape...

		Realising that trying to fight your way past four heavily-armed and armoured SWORD Enforcers is not a very good idea, you try to think of another way to get past them and escape from the warehouse. After a moment of all sorts of ideas running through your head, you suddenly remember the curious weapon you found earlier. Holding the small arcane lightning globe up in front of you, you wonder if you could somehow channel your aura into it in order to trigger a lightning discharge of the same sort that hit you and Claire. Perhaps if you were able to do that, and get it to hit all of the guards, they'd be so turned on that they wouldn't notice you and Claire sneaking past them...

		Confident that your plan is sure to succeed, you turn your attention back towards the little crystal globe in your [pc.hand]. Just like before, as it's come into contact with someone, the interior of the glass sphere is now filled with jumping arcs of arcane lightning. Concentrating on channelling all of your aura into this strange weapon, you instinctively feel as though the energy contained with is getting more and more unstable. Just as you sense that it can't take any more, you peek around the corner and roll the globe towards the group of Enforcers.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Take cover!)] Claire hisses at you, pulling you back behind the boxes. As the worried cat-girl pulls you in tight against her massive breasts, a bright purple flash of arcane lightning temporarily illuminates your surroundings, letting you know that the arcane discharge was successful.

	<p>
		[npc.speech(Fuck... W-What was that?!)] you hear one of the Enforcers shout, [npc.her] voice already taking on a sensual tone.

		Peeking around the corner once again, you see that all four of the SWORD guards have started to passionately make out with one another. Abandoning their posts, they've split off into two pairs, and are far too busy kissing and groping one other to be paying attention to their surroundings. Taking this opportunity to make your move, you tell Claire to stay close, before starting to sneak over towards the warehouse doors. Thankfully, the Enforcers are so preoccupied with starting to fuck one another that they don't even glance your way, and not only are you able to approach the exit without issue, but you're also able to sneak across and pick up the lightning globe.
