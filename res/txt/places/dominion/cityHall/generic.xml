		This particular street is dominated by the huge structure of Dominion's city hall.

	<p>
		Walking up the short series of polished marble steps which lead to city hall's main entrance, you find yourself confronted by a pair of revolving glass doors. Heading through the one marked 'Entrance', you step into the main foyer and take a look at your new surroundings.

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_FOYER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The grand entrance to Dominion's city hall gives visitors the impression of great wealth and prestige. Huge marble pillars line the edges of this colossal foyer, and between them, sitting upon the polished marble floor, are numerous finely-carved busts of notable demons. Hanging from the walls are gigantic portraits of yet more demons and half-demons, with nameplates identifying them as particularly important members of the local government. Looking up at the high vaulted ceiling, you see the source of this area's illumination taking the form of several huge, crystal chandeliers.
	</p>
	<p>
		On one end of this grand foyer, there's the pair of revolving glass doors which serve as the public entrance and exit, while on the other, a huge, circular desk is staffed by ten or so receptionists, who each wait patiently to answer any queries directed their way by visiting members of the public. Beyond that, the entrance hall branches off left and right into two corridors, which lead into the depths of this centre of bureaucracy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although not busy by any stretch of the imagination, several members of the public are milling around in this area, and are no doubt waiting for their friends or companions to finish conducting whatever business they had within.

		Near the far end of the grand foyer, there's a huge, circular desk, which is staffed by ten or so receptionists. It's beside this desk that you currently find yourself standing, and you wonder whether you should approach one of the helpful-looking girls currently on duty, or simply head past them without asking for assistance.

[genericFemale.speech(You need to head that way, and at the end of the corridor, take another left, and then the office you're looking for will be at the end of that corridor on your right.

There's also no need to wait for an appointment; the Bureau of Demographics is always open to all members of the public. Have a nice day!)]

	<p>
		Without asking if there was anything else you needed, the receptionist calls out to someone standing behind you, and proceeds to ask them if there's anything she can help them with. As you've already got the information you wanted, you step away from the desk and wonder if you should head down to this 'Bureau of Demographics' right away...

		[genericFemale.speech(Oh, I'm sorry, [pc.sir],)] the receptionist says, the forced smile on her face making it clear that she isn't actually sorry at all. [genericFemale.speech(The transfer of property rights have recently been suspended, and there's no telling when they might be available again. For future reference, the Bureau of Property and Commerce is down the corridor on the right. Have a good day!)]

		Looking right past you, the girl then calls out to someone who was waiting behind you, and proceeds to ask them if they need any assistance. As your question has now been answered, you step away from the desk and wonder what to do next...

		Just like the main foyer, the corridors of Dominion's city hall are a grand affair. Polished marble flooring, high-vaulted ceilings, and impressive portraits lining the walls all give the impression of great wealth and importance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although there are several office workers and self-important bureaucrats hurrying to and fro, the corridor is easily wide enough to accommodate all of you, and, thanks to this abundance of space, you find that there's no need for anyone to adjust their tangent as you all continue on your separate ways.
