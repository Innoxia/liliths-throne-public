		This particular street is dominated by the huge structure of Dominion's city hall. The architecture of this seat of local government is distinctly classical, with the frontage consisting of a series of huge marble pillars and polished stone steps. A sign near the entrance of this impressive building informs you that it's <b>open to the public from nine in the morning to four in the afternoon</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(game.getCurrentWeather()==WEATHER_MAGIC_STORM)
			As there's an arcane storm raging overhead, your surroundings are almost completely deserted, with only the occasional demon to be seen walking down the street.
			#IF(game.getHourOfDay()>=9 && game.getHourOfDay()<=16)
				 As city hall is [style.colourGood(currently open to the public)], you wonder how people are inside due to legitimate business, and how many are making use of the building to simply take shelter from the storm.
			#ELSE
				 Unfortunately, due to the time of day, city hall is [style.colourBad(currently closed to the public)], so if you had any business within, you'll have to return during regular opening times.
			#ENDIF
		#ELSE
			#IF(game.getHourOfDay()>=9 && game.getHourOfDay()<=16)
				As city hall is [style.colourGood(currently open to the public)], you could always head inside and seek to conduct whatever business you have to attend to.
			#ELSE
				Unfortunately, due to the time of day, city hall is [style.colourBad(currently closed to the public)], so if you had any business within, you'll have to return during regular opening times.

	<htmlContent tag="ENTRY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Walking up the short series of polished marble steps which lead to city hall's main entrance, you find yourself confronted by a pair of revolving glass doors. Heading through the one marked 'Entrance', you step into the main foyer and take a look at your new surroundings.

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_FOYER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The entrance to Dominion's city hall gives visitors the impression of great wealth and prestige. Huge marble pillars line the edges of the colossal foyer, and between them, sitting upon the polished marble floor, are numerous ornate sofas and antique cabinets. Hanging from the walls are gigantic portraits of regal-looking demons, with nameplates identifying them as particularly important members of the local government. The entire area is illuminated by soft white light given off from huge, crystal chandeliers which hang from the vaulted ceiling overhead.
	</p>
	<p>
		On one side of this grand entrance hall, there's the pair of revolving glass doors which serve as the public entrance and exit, while on the other, a huge, circular desk is staffed by ten or so receptionists, who each wait patiently to answer any queries directed their way by visiting members of the public. Beyond that, the entrance hall branches off left and right into two corridors, which lead into the depths of this centre of bureaucracy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although not busy by any stretch of the imagination, several members of the public are milling around in this area, no doubt waiting for their friends or companions who are conducting business within.

	<p>
		Near the far end of the grand foyer, there's a huge, circular desk, which is staffed by ten or so receptionists. It's beside this desk that you currently find yourself standing, and you wonder whether you should approach one of the helpful-looking girls currently on duty, or simply head off into city hall without asking for directions.

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_INFORMATION_DESK_NAME_CHANGE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to know where to go in order to get your name officially changed, you step up to the desk and ask one of the receptionists for directions.
	</p>
	<p>
		[genericFemale.speech(Ah, you'll want the Bureau of Demographics for that,)] the girl happily answers, before turning in her chair and pointing down the corridor which leads to the left. [genericFemale.speech(You need to head that way, and at the end of the corridor, take another left, and then the office you're looking for will be at the end of that corridor on your right. Applying for a change of name is considered minor business, so I believe you'll only need to fill out forms 2-B, 7-D, and the usual collection of A-series documents from 1 to 13. There's also no need to wait for an appointment; the Bureau of Demographics is always open to all members of the public. Have a nice day!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Without asking if there was anything else you needed, the receptionist calls out to someone standing behind you, and proceeds to ask them if there's anything she can help them with. As you've already got the information you were after, you step away from the desk and wonder if you should head down to this 'Bureau of Demographics' right away...

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_INFORMATION_DESK_PROPERTY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Curious about the purchase of property in Dominion, you approach the information desk and ask one of the free receptionists where you'd need to go to talk about such a matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		[genericFemale.speech(Oh, I'm sorry, [pc.sir],)] the receptionist says, the smile on her face making it clear that she isn't actually sorry at all. [genericFemale.speech(The transfer of property rights have recently been suspended, and there's no telling when they might be available again. For future reference, the Bureau of Property and Commerce is down the corridor on the right. Have a good day!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking right past you, the girl then calls out to someone who was waiting behind you, and proceeds to ask them if they need any assistance. As you've obtained got the information which you were looking for, you step away from the desk and wonder what to do next...

	<p>
		Just like the main foyer, the corridors of Dominion's city hall are a grand affair. Polished marble flooring, high-vaulted ceilings, and impressive portraits lining the walls all give the impression of great wealth and importance. Although there are several office workers and self-important bureaucrats hurrying to and fro, the corridor is easily wide enough to accommodate all of you, and, thanks to this abundance of space, you find that there's no need for anyone to adjust their tangent as you all continue on your separate ways.

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_WAITING_AREA"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		For those residents of Dominion who have specific business with the city's administrators, a large, well-furnished waiting room has been provided. Sitting upon the many low-backed sofas which litter this area, there are numerous members of the public, and you see that many of them are holding little ticket stubs. A large, arcane-powered notification board is fixed to the far wall, and you see that it reads: <i>Now serving: [#((game.getHourOfDay()*115)+(game.getDayMinutes()%60)).toFixed(0)]</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Shuddering at the thought of being at the mercy of the painfully-slow bureaucracy, and with nothing more to do in this area, you prepare to turn around and continue on your way...

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_OFFICE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The door to the office before you is made from frosted glass, and you see that the word <i>'Private'</i> is emblazoned upon it. Knowing that such a place must house the very worst inefficiencies that a government institution has to offer, you decide against taking a look inside, and instead turn around and prepare to continue on your way elsewhere...

	<htmlContent tag="CITY_HALL_STAIRS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The stairs before you lead to the upper floors of city hall, but a barrier of red rope bars your passage and prevents you from scaling them. As if to make it even clearer that you have no business up there, a little sign hangs from the obstacle, which reads: <i>'Private: Admission only to holders of pass type 13-F or higher.'</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if you were to simply step over this barrier and proceed upstairs, you know that only the dull inner-workings of government bureaucracy would await you, and so, with that in mind, you turn around and decide to head elsewhere...
