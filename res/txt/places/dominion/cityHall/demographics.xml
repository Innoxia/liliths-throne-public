		Description of office desk and chair, with the room stretching off to your left. You see that it looks like a massive archive, as it is filled with bookcases. Nameplate on desk saying 'Ms. Cunningham', and beside that, a sign saying to ring the bell if she isn't present.

			You ring the bell, and after about ten seconds or so, the familiar figure of [vanessa.name] appears from behind a nearby bookcase. In contrast to the first time you met her, you notice that there's a jovial spring to her step, and her bright blue eyes light up in delight as she sees that it's you who's come to visit her. [vanessa.speech([pc.Name]! It's wonderful to see you again!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			After the intimate affair the two of you had in this very office, you've obviously left quite a lasting impression upon the elderly fox-girl, and instead of striding over and collapsing down into her chair, she rushes up to stand close in front of you, before seductively biting her lip and teasing, [vanessa.speech(You know, I'm still having to be up and about on my feet all day... I couldn't persuade you to give me another of those special massages of yours, could I?)]
		</p>
	#ELSEIF(game.getDialogueFlags().hasFlag(FLAG_vanessaIntroduced))

			You ring the bell, and after about thirty seconds or so, the familiar figure of [vanessa.name] appears from behind a nearby bookcase.

		</p>
	#ELSE
		<p>
			You ring the bell, and after about thirty seconds or so, a womanly figure, dressed in smart office attire, appears from behind a nearby bookcase. Looking over at the woman who must be 'Ms. Cunningham', the first thing you notice is that, with the exception of a fox's tail and a pair of fox ears on top of her head, she appears to be entirely human. As she confidently walks over to her desk, you note that she appears to be in her mid-fifties, and that both the fur covering her fox parts, as well as her long, braided hair, are grey with age. Despite the fact that she seems to be getting on in years, she's aged remarkably well, and while she doesn't possess the same youthful good-looks of someone half her age, she nevertheless has a refined, elegant beauty about her.
		</p>
		<p>
			While not having a detrimental effect on her looks, her age does seem to be taking a toll on her in a couple of other ways. First of all, there's the fact that she's wearing a pair of half-moon reading glasses, letting you know that her eyesight isn't perfect. Furthermore, as confidently as she tries to carry herself, you can't help but notice that there's a slight air of lethargy about her, and as she steps up to her desk, she half-sits, half-collapses down into her chair.
		</p>
		<p>
			Letting out a weary sigh, the elderly fox-girl peers at you over the top of her glasses and says, [vanessa.speech(Good #IF(game.isMorning())morning#ELSEafternoon#ENDIF, my name is 'Ms. Cunningham', and I am both the manager of, and sole employee assigned to, the Bureau of Demographics.

			Looking across to the archive's shelves, you see quite a large number of boxes piled up that are marked 'For sorting', and you realise that [vanessa.name] is once again struggling to keep on top of her work. Although she appears to have a lot more energy and enthusiasm since the two of you had sex, you imagine that the elderly fox-girl would still appreciate an offer of help. Smiling fondly at her, you ask, [pc.speech(Would you like some help with your cataloguing work again? I have some time to spare.)]

		<p>
			[vanessa.speech(Without filing the assistance forms?)] [vanessa.name] teases, blushing at the thought of accepting help without following the proper procedure. [vanessa.speech(I suppose we could be naughty and do it together again...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Having obtained [vanessa.namePos] consent, you start walking over towards the boxes. As you do so, the fox-girl quickly follows in your footsteps, and as you come to a halt, she leans in against your back and sighs, [vanessa.speech(Perhaps after we're finished, we could do something else that's very naughty together...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Stepping around in front of you, [vanessa.name] picks up the top box, before telling you to grab one and follow her into the archives. Doing as you're told, you grab the box and follow [vanessa.namePos] lead as she heads into the maze-like shelving of the archives. Soon arriving at your destination, the fox-girl turns towards you and says, [vanessa.speech(The papers within the box are already sorted alphabetically, so all you need to do is to slot them into the shelves in the correct order.

And that's not to mention the liability waiver forms that need to be submitted and approved. I... I can't accept your help without those...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Although she's sticking to regulations, you can tell that [vanessa.name] really does want some help, and so you press her, [pc.speech(You're the only one in here; nobody's going to know if I've helped you out or not. Do you want me to help?)]
		</p>

			[vanessa.speech(Well, yes, but-)] [vanessa.name] replies, but she cuts her sentence short as you turn and start walking over towards the boxes. [vanessa.speech(Wait! You can't enter that area without filing form 41-A!)]
