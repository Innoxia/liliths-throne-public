	<p>
		Once again, you find yourself [pc.walking] past the immaculately-clean, regency-styled residences which line the street upon which Nyan's apartment building is located. [pc.Walking] up the steps to the front door, you make use of the arcane intercom to buzz your girlfriend. After a momentary pause, you hear Nyan's voice call out over the intercom, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Hello? This is Ms. [nyan.surname], who is it?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After quickly telling her that it's you, and that you're here to pick her up for a date, Nyan lets out an excited squeak and quickly replies, [nyan.speechNoEffects([pc.Name]! Come on in! Just wait in the lobby, ok? I'll be down in ten minutes!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Hearing a loud clicking noise from behind the front door, you experimentally push on it and discover that it's been unlocked. Doing as your girlfriend says, you enter the smartly-kept foyer and wait for her to come down from her apartment. Thankfully, she's no longer than she said she'd be, for after just ten minutes you hear your girlfriend coming down the stairs, and then just a moment later, she's rushing forwards to give you a big hug and a kiss.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of her usual skirt and blouse, she's wearing [nyan.a_slotClothing(TORSO_UNDER, true)], with a colour-coordinated bow on her headband. In addition to this, she's carrying
		#IF(game.getSeason()==SEASON_SUMMER)
			 both her stylish, tan-coloured coat and cute, frog-styled umbrella in her arms, and is wearing a pair of dark brown chelsea boots.
		#ELSE
			 her stylish, tan-coloured coat, black scarf, and cute, frog-styled umbrella in her arms, and is wearing a pair of dark brown thigh-high boots.
		#ENDIF
		 Just like the last time you went out on a date with her, your girlfriend is wearing a noticeable amount of makeup, and you can't help but instantly think how her red lipstick, black eye-liner, and light blue eye-shadow makes her look more attractive and alluring than ever before.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pulling back from your kiss, you compliment Nyan on how beautiful she looks, which causes her cheeks to turn a bright shade of red. Coyly shuffling her feet, she glances at you with her big, blue eyes and explains, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I couldn't risk you coming up to the apartment just yet; my mum's here, and if she sees you again, she's going to be in a mood... Anyway, are you ready to go?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Replying in the affirmative, you wait for the cute cat-girl to pull on her coat, before accompanying her over towards the apartment building's front door...

			As you approach the exit, a bright pink light suddenly flashes through the windows, causing Nyan to let out a little eek and whine, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh no... There's an arcane storm! Perhaps if we wait for the thunder to pass, then run for the Arcade, we could make it?)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Asking Nyan if she's sure that she wants to risk it, and receiving a rapid nod of her head in response, you wait for the next clap of thunder to pass before opening the door and hurrying down the steps with your girlfriend at your side. Clutching her little umbrella in her delicate hands, the cat-girl surprisingly proves to be an extremely capable runner. Her unexpected sprint proves to be very fortuitous, for the two of you manage to reach the doors of the Shopping Arcade without being subjected to a clap of arousing thunder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rushing through the entrance and shutting the doors after you, Nyan heavily pants, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Phew... We made it... I can't... believe that worked...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			After giving your girlfriend some time in which to catch her breath, you accompany her down the wide, marble walkways of the Arcade, and soon arrive at your destination of the restaurant, 'The Oaken Glade'. Holding open the front door and allowing Nyan to step inside, you follow her through and are immediately met by a smartly-dressed otter-boy, who is quite clearly the establishment's maître d'. Looking over at Nyan, he gives her a big, familiar smile, before slightly bowing his head and offering his enthusiastic greetings, [style.speechMasculine(Good evening, good evening! If you and your partner for this evening would care to follow me, I will show you to your seats. After all, we always have a table for you!)]

			 With her cute frog-umbrella coming to the rescue, Nyan steps outside and pops it open, before shyly stuttering, [nyan.speechNoEffects(This is big enough for both of us... So we can walk close together and share it...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanking your girlfriend for her kindness, you do as she suggests and share the umbrella with her. Clearly being very happy at getting to share this moment with you, Nyan blushes and leans into you as you travel down the street. Unfortunately for her, however, this time together under her umbrella doesn't last long, as it only takes you five minutes to arrive at the doors of the Shopping Arcade.
		</p>
	#ELSE
		<p>
			As you approach the exit, you see through the windows that the weather outside isn't going to prove to be an issue. After holding open the door for your girlfriend, you accompany her down the steps and then proceed on your way down the street. Clearly being very excited about going out on a date with you, Nyan walks right by your side for the whole five minutes that it takes to get to the Shopping Arcade.

		As you follow the waiter to the far side of the restaurant, you see that all of the tables are occupied either by couples or small groups of friends, despite the place always looking empty from the outside. Realising that this aspect of the restaurant's illusion must have been designed to grant diners some privacy, you continue on to the other side of what appears in all respects to be a tranquil forest clearing, where you and Nyan are presented with a quiet corner table for two.
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking your girlfriend's coat and umbrella, the waiter seats you both at the table and gives you each a menu, before handing you the wine list and telling you to please take your time in ordering. Looking across the table and giving you her most alluring look, Nyan bites her lip and asks, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Could we order some white wine, please? I don't mind what bottle, so could you please choose for me?)]

		From the smile on her face, you can tell that Nyan is pleased with your choice of wine, and as she hands her wine list back to the waiter, she happily sighs, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Thanks, [pc.name], I've had that wine before, and I really like it...)]

	<p>
		Finally having some time in which to talk with one another, you and Nyan start discussing the food that's on the menu. Just like the last time, she decides to order tsipoura, and talks you into ordering starters. Giving the waiter your order, you request a candle to be lit on your table, which Nyan is very excited about.
	</p>
	<p>
		[nyan.speechNoEffects(That's perfect... I love coming here with you, [pc.name]...)] Nyan happily sighs, before slightly hardening her expression and declaring, [nyan.speechNoEffects(You're going to get grilled by my mum again... You know that, right? I was kind of upset that you couldn't answer her questions the last time, so I'm going to go over everything with you tonight, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not having much choice in the matter, you find the conversation being completely dominated by Nyan's explanation of her likes, dislikes, and history. By the time your starters arrive, you've already heard about how [style.italicsGood(her favourite food is tsipoura)], as well as how [style.italicsGood(she used to bake pastries every morning for her mother)]. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As your starters are cleared away, the topic of conversation briefly turns to other matters, such as how Nyan's day has been so far. It only takes a few minutes for that to change, however, as Nyan soon sighs, [nyan.speech(You know, it really is important for you to gain my mum's approval. Without her accepting our relationship, I don't know how things are going to be able to continue...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling your girlfriend that you'll do your best to answer the questions you're sure to be subjected to later this evening, you listen as she starts once again to fill you in on the details of her life. You soon learn that [style.italicsGood(her store was called 'Golden Threads')] before her mother gave it to her to take over, and that [style.italicsGood(her favourite flowers are daisies)], and she used to love seeing them in the fields when she and her mother took trips to the countryside.
	</p>
	<p>
		At that point the waiter returns to your table to deliver your main meals, and as you and Nyan get started, conversation turns to the quality of food and the excellence of the restaurant's illusion spell. Soon enough, the two of you have finished eating, and as the waiter returns and offers you the dessert menu, your girlfriend happily exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh, yes! Could we please share some ice cream?)] 
	</p>
	<p>
		Agreeing to share some ice cream with your girlfriend, you finish your date by listening to her talk all about her romance novels. It's from this impromptu lecture that you lean that [style.italicsGood(Nyan's favourite book is called 'One Day in June')], and that she owns well over two hundred different books.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having finally told you all there is to know about her, your girlfriend lets out a deep sigh and smiles at you in a deeply affectionate manner. Seizing this opportunity, you finish your dessert and start to flirt with her, and from her eager responses and happy little giggles, you can soon tell that she's going to want more than just kiss tonight.
	</p>
	<p>
		With both of you ready to leave, you call over the waiter and ask for the bill. Swiftly doing as you ask, he presents you with tonight's cost, and you see that you're being charged an eye-watering [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] flames...

	<p>
		After you've quickly settled the bill, the waiter retrieves Nyan's coat and umbrella, before seeing the two of you to the door and thanking you for your business. As you [pc.step] out into the Shopping Arcade, Nyan performs an uncharacteristic move, and boldly initiates physical contact by taking hold of your [pc.wing] and leaning into your body. Letting out a happy little giggle, she exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(That was so fun, [pc.name]! Thank you so much!)]

	#IF(game.getCurrentWeather()==WEATHER_MAGIC_STORM)

			Returning your girlfriend's sentiments, you accompany her to the exit of the Shopping Arcade, where you see through the glass doors that there's an ongoing arcane storm. Letting out a little eek, Nyan huddles up to you and whines, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh no... Perhaps if we hurry, it won't affect me too much...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Doing as the cat-girl suggests, the two of you wait for the next clap of thunder to pass before hurrying outside and down the street towards her apartment. By a stroke of particularly good fortune, you manage to avoid both strikes of thunder and horny citizens during your dash towards Nyan's home. As you reach the steps of her apartment building, however, the storm above makes up for its unusual silence by unleashing one of the most powerful claps of arcane thunder you've ever heard.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite pulling her through the entrance and slamming the door shut behind you, you're not able to save Nyan from the arousing effects of the storm, and before you know what's happening, the cat-girl is frantically pressing her [nyan.lips+] against your mouth and lustfully grinding herself against your body. Protected from any further claps of thunder, Nyan soon starts to come back to her senses, and with a little eek, she breaks off the kiss and exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I'm sorry, [pc.name]! I-I couldn't stop myself!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Telling her that there's nothing to be sorry about, you reassuringly stroke Nyan's arm, which has the desired effect of calming her down. Making your way up the flights of stairs to the third floor, the two of you soon arrive at the door to your girlfriend's apartment, where she turns to face you and nervously shuffles her feet, before looking at you with her big, blue eyes and asking, [nyan.speechNoEffects(You're going to come in, aren't you?

	</p>
	<p>
		Accompanying your girlfriend into her flat, you head into the lounge and once again find yourself meeting her mother, [nyanmum.name], who's sitting on the far sofa. Seeing you with her daughter once again, [nyanmum.name] lets out a deep growl, before asking, [nyanmum.speech(What are you doing here?

		Realising that confrontation with Nyan's mother will surely put an end to your relationship, you swallow your pride and do as you're told. Sitting down on the sofa, you look across to see that Nyan is so embarrassed by what's happening that she's covered her face with her hands. Still stroking her daughter's head, Nyan's mother sharply states, [nyanmum.speech(Seeing as Nyan seems to be so fond of you, I'll allow you to be interviewed for a second time.

		Unable to recall what Nyan's favourite flowers were, you begin to reply that [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] are her favourite. As she realises that you're about to respond incorrectly, Nyan gestures upwards to the painting hanging above their sofa. As it's depicting a scene of a flower full of daisies, you change your answer and tell [nyanmum.name] that your girlfriend's favourite flowers are daisies. For the first time since meeting her, you see [nyanmum.name] flash you a slight smile, and she ponders out loud, [nyanmum.speech(Maybe you really do care for Nyan...)]

		You confidently reply that Nyan's favourite flowers are daisies, and that they were her favourite sight when visiting the countryside. For the first time since meeting her, you see [nyanmum.name] flash you a slight smile, and she ponders out loud, [nyanmum.speech(Maybe you really do care for Nyan...)]

		[nyan.speechNoEffects(I told you, mum!)] Nyan exclaims, before taking hold of her mother's hand and pleading, [nyan.speechNoEffects(C-Can you please stop this now?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Hardening her expression, [nyanmum.name] replies, [nyanmum.speech(I have one last question to ask, and anyone who's seriously interested in you would know the answer to it.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before revealing her final question, however, [nyanmum.name] has one last trick up her sleeve, or, more accurately, up her skirt. Sitting upright, she spreads her legs a little, and thanks to the fact that her bodycon dress has a relatively short skirt, she ends up brazenly flashing you her underwear. Clearly well aware of what she's doing, she slides her left leg further to one side, making it impossible not to notice the fact that her dark purple thong is completely crotchless. Shamelessly flashing you her naked pussy, she spreads her legs even wider, and with her large, dark labia fully on display, she deviously smirks at you and asks, [nyanmum.speech(What's the matter? I hope you're not getting distracted by anything. Now tell me the name of Nyan's favourite book.)]

		Distracted by [nyanmum.namePos] lewd display, you fail to recall what Nyan's favourite book was called. Stumbling around for a title, you make a wild guess and start to say that it's '[#SPECIAL_PARSE_0]'. Shaking her head, Nyan stops you before you're able to finish giving this answer, and in a moment of clarity, you say instead that it was called 'One Day in June'. Still keeping her legs spread, [nyanmum.name] leans back on the sofa and sighs, [nyanmum.speech(Fine... I suppose you really do care about Nyan...)]

		Managing to avoid being distracted by [nyanmum.namePos] lewd display, you correctly respond by saying that Nyan's favourite book is called 'One Day in June'. Still keeping her legs spread, she leans back on the sofa and sighs, [nyanmum.speech(Fine... I suppose you really do care about Nyan...)]

		[nyan.speechNoEffects(You're finished, mum?)] Nyan asks, seemingly completely oblivious as to what her mother is currently doing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Flashing you a devious smirk, [nyanmum.name] snaps her legs shut, before reaching over to pat her daughter on the head. Letting out a big yawn and stretching her muscular arms up above her head, she reveals, [nyanmum.speech(Yes, I've finished with my questioning. I've had a busy day, so I'm going to bed now. Oh, by the way, I'm going to be staying here with you for the foreseeable future. I've appointed subordinates to handle all of my businesses, and I need to take a long break. Your quaint little apartment and company is exactly what I need.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not giving her daughter any question in the matter, [nyanmum.name] stands up and gives you one last warning, [nyanmum.speech(If you do anything to upset my sweet little Nyan, I'll make you pay.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After demanding a goodnight hug and kiss from her daughter, [nyanmum.name] strides over to the door, calling behind her as she goes, [nyanmum.speech(I'll be using the spare room. Good night!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Stopping in the doorway, [nyanmum.name] swishes her tail to one side, before turning and flashing you another devious grin. Narrowing her yellow, cat-like eyes, she asks, [nyanmum.speech(Oh, [pc.name], please try not to make my daughter moan too loudly tonight; I really could do with my beauty sleep.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Nyan's mother disappears around the corner, leaving her furiously-blushing daughter to collapse down on the sofa and cover her face with her hands. Peeking between her fingers, she groans, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I'm so, so sorry about that... Mum can get quite intense, and I n-never expected her to be here...)]
