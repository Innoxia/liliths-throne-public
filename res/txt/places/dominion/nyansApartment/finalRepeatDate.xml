		Once again, you find yourself [pc.walking] past the immaculately-clean, regency-styled residences which line the street upon which Nyan's apartment building is located. [pc.Walking] up the steps to the front door, you make use of the arcane intercom to buzz your girlfriend. After a momentary pause, you hear Nyan's voice call out over the intercom, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Hello? This is Ms. [nyan.surname], who is it?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After quickly telling her that it's you, and that you're here to pick her up for a date, Nyan lets out an excited squeak and quickly replies, [nyan.speechNoEffects([pc.Name]! Come on up!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Hearing a loud clicking noise from behind the front door, you experimentally push on it and discover that it's been unlocked. Doing as your girlfriend says, you enter the smartly-kept foyer and head up to her apartment. Greeting her with a loving hug and a kiss, you enter Nyan's apartment and wait in the lounge for her to get ready for your date. After just ten minutes, you hear the cat-girl returning down the hallway, and you reach the door of the lounge at the same moment in which she does.
	</p>
	<p>
		[nyan.speech(I'm ready now!)] the cat-girl happily exclaims, before doing a little twirl and showing off her outfit. Instead of her usual skirt and blouse, you see that she's wearing [nyan.a_slotClothing(TORSO_UNDER, true)], with a colour-coordinated bow on her headband. Just like the last time you went out on a date with her, your girlfriend is wearing a noticeable amount of makeup, and you can't help but instantly think how her red lipstick, black eye-liner, and light blue eye-shadow makes her look more attractive and alluring than ever before.
	</p>
	<p>
		After giving her a quick kiss, and making her blush in the process, you accompany Nyan to the front door, where she pulls on

		 After she's picked up her cute frog-umbrella, you lead Nyan out of her apartment and down the stairs, before accompanying her over towards the building's exit...

			As you approach the exit, a bright pink light suddenly flashes through the windows, causing Nyan to let out a little eek and whine, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh no... There's an arcane storm! Perhaps if we wait for the thunder to pass, then run for the Arcade, we could make it?)]

		<p>
			Asking Nyan if she's sure that she wants to risk it, and receiving a rapid nod of her head in response, you wait for the next clap of thunder to pass before opening the door and hurrying down the steps with your girlfriend at your side. Clutching her little umbrella in her delicate hands, the cat-girl surprisingly proves to be an extremely capable runner. Her unexpected sprint proves to be very fortuitous, for the two of you manage to reach the doors of the Shopping Arcade without being subjected to a clap of arousing thunder.

Looking over at Nyan, he gives her a big, familiar smile, before slightly bowing his head and offering his enthusiastic greetings, [style.speechMasculine(Good evening, good evening!

	<p>
		Taking your girlfriend's coat and umbrella, the waiter seats you both at the table and gives you each a menu, before handing you the wine list and telling you to please take your time in ordering. Looking across the table and giving you her most alluring look, Nyan bites her lip and asks, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Could we order some white wine, please?

Giving the waiter your order, you request a candle to be lit on your table, which Nyan is very excited about.

		[nyan.speechNoEffects(That's perfect... I love coming here with you, [pc.name]...)] Nyan happily sighs, before engaging you in conversation about how her week has been. After a short while your starters arrive, and the two of you exchange opinions of the quality of the food while working your way through them.

	<p>
		The rest of the evening proceeds in the typical fashion, with you and your girlfriend talking about all manner of topics. Enjoying your main meals, you order a dessert to share, and by the time you're ready to leave, Nyan is lovingly gazing into your eyes and smiling at you in a deeply affectionate manner. Flirting with her a little, you draw out several eager responses and happy little giggles, and you can clearly tell that Nyan is going to want to do more than just kiss tonight.
	</p>
	<p>

		After you've quickly settled the bill, the waiter retrieves Nyan's coat and umbrella, before seeing the two of you to the door and thanking you for your business. As you [pc.step] out into the Shopping Arcade, Nyan performs an uncharacteristic move, and boldly initiates physical contact by taking hold of your [pc.wing] and leaning into your body.

			Returning your girlfriend's sentiments, you accompany her to the exit of the Shopping Arcade, where you see through the glass doors that there's an ongoing arcane storm. Letting out a little eek, Nyan huddles up to you and whines, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh no... Perhaps if we hurry, it won't affect me too much...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Doing as the cat-girl suggests, the two of you wait for the next clap of thunder to pass before hurrying outside and down the street towards her apartment. By a stroke of particularly good fortune, you manage to avoid both strikes of thunder and horny citizens during your dash towards Nyan's home. As you reach the steps of her apartment building, however, the storm above makes up for its unusual silence by unleashing one of the most powerful claps of arcane thunder you've ever heard.

			Despite pulling her through the entrance and slamming the door shut behind you, you're not able to save Nyan from the arousing effects of the storm, and before you know what's happening, the cat-girl is frantically pressing her [nyan.lips+] against your mouth and lustfully grinding herself against your body. Protected from any further claps of thunder, Nyan soon starts to come back to her senses, and with a little eek, she breaks off the kiss and exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I'm sorry, [pc.name]! I-I couldn't stop myself!)]

			Telling her that there's nothing to be sorry about, you reassuringly stroke Nyan's arm, which has the desired effect of calming her down.

Taking hold of her hips, you passionately return Nyan's kiss, and quickly find yourself being half-led, half-dragged towards her bedroom.

		Within moments, you're standing beside your girlfriend's bed, and after finally breaking off from her kiss, she impatiently strips out of her dress, leaving her standing in just her light-pink lingerie.

After giving you a glass and placing your bottled water down on the table, the otter-boy waits for [nyanmum.name] to taste the wine she's ordered. Receiving her enthusiastic approval, he then pours out a glass for her and Nyan, before placing the bottle in an arcane-powered cooler and leaving it on the table. Saying that he'll return shortly to take your food orders, he swiftly departs once again, leaving the three of you alone.

		Wanting to drink something other than wine, you tell the waiter that you'd like to order a bottle of beer. Nodding his head, he swiftly departs and then returns with your chosen beverages. After expertly pouring out your beer and placing the glass down before you, the otter-boy waits for [nyanmum.name] to taste the wine she's ordered. Receiving her enthusiastic approval, he then pours out a glass for her and Nyan, before placing the bottle in an arcane-powered cooler and leaving it on the table. Saying that he'll return shortly to take your food orders, he swiftly departs once again, leaving the three of you alone.

	<p>
		Finally having some time in which to talk with one another, the three of you start discussing the food that's on the menu. Just like the last time, Nyan decides to order tsipoura, while [nyanmum.name] orders steak and talks you into ordering starters. Giving the waiter your order, you request a candle to be lit on your table, which Nyan is very excited about.
	</p>
	<p>
		[nyan.speechNoEffects(That's perfect... I love coming here with you, [pc.name]...)] Nyan happily sighs, before engaging you and [nyanmum.name] in conversation about how her week has been. After a short while your starters arrive, and the three of you exchange opinions of the quality of the food while working your way through them.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rest of the evening proceeds in the typical fashion, with you and your girlfriends talking about all manner of topics. By the time you've finished your main meals, Nyan is lovingly gazing into your eyes and smiling at you in a deeply affectionate manner. Flirting with her and her mother a little, you draw out several eager responses and happy little giggles, and you can clearly tell that both Nyan and [nyanmum.name] are going to want to do more than just kiss tonight. This is made very clear when you ask the two of them if they'd like dessert, to which [nyanmum.name] replies, [nyanmum.speech(We've already got our dessert planned... Let's head back so Nyan and I can enjoy [pc.herHim]...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With the horny cat-girls clearly ready to leave, you call over the waiter and ask for the bill. Swiftly doing as you ask, he presents you with tonight's cost, and you see that you're being charged an eye-watering [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] flames...

		After you've quickly settled the bill, the waiter retrieves Nyan's coat and umbrella, before seeing the three of you to the door and thanking you for your business. As you [pc.step] out into the Shopping Arcade, both Nyan and [nyanmum.name] immediately make a move on you, with each of them leaning in to opposite sides of your body and taking hold of your [pc.arms]. Letting out an excited little moan, [nyanmum.name] teases, [nyanmum.speech(Come on then, [pc.name]; the sooner we get home, the sooner Nyan and I can be spreading our legs for you...)]
	</p>

			With your two girlfriends clinging on to you, you head to the exit of the Shopping Arcade, where you see through the glass doors that there's an ongoing arcane storm. Letting out a little eek, Nyan huddles up to you and whines, [nyan.speechNoEffects(Oh no... Perhaps if we run, it won't affect me too much...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			[nyanmum.speech(While I do need a good fuck, I'd rather not do it in the middle of the street,)] [nyanmum.name] crudely adds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Deciding to do as Nyan suggested, the three of you wait for the next clap of thunder to pass before running outside and down the street towards her apartment. By a stroke of particularly good fortune, you manage to avoid both strikes of thunder and horny citizens during your dash towards Nyan's home. As you reach the steps of her apartment building, however, the storm above makes up for its unusual silence by unleashing one of the most powerful claps of arcane thunder you've ever heard.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite pulling them through the entrance and slamming the door shut behind you, you're not able to save Nyan and her mother from the arousing effects of the storm, and before you know what's happening, the cat-girls are lustfully grinding themselves against you and planting a series of passionate kisses all over your face. Protected from any further claps of thunder, they soon start to come back to her senses, and with a little eek, Nyan pulls back exclaims, [nyan.speechNoEffects(I'm sorry, [pc.name]! I-I couldn't stop myself!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Not being as embarrassed as her daughter, [nyanmum.name] plants one last kiss on your [pc.lips], before also pulling back and teasing, [nyanmum.speech(That's just a taste of what you're going to be getting this evening...)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Telling Nyan that there's nothing to be sorry about, you reassuringly stroke her arm, which has the desired effect of calming her down. Making your way up the flights of stairs to the third floor, the three of you soon arrive at the door to your girlfriends' apartment. Taking hold of your [pc.hand], [nyanmum.name] wastes no time in pulling you inside, and as Nyan closes the door after you, her mother tells you, [nyanmum.speech(Go and wait in the lounge, [pc.name]. Nyan and I need to slip into something a little more comfortable for you...)]

	<p>
		You're soon drawn out of your thoughts, however, for you suddenly hear the high-pitched giggling of Nyan drifting down the hallway. This is soon followed by the deeper voice of [nyanmum.name], but you can't quite make out what exactly she's saying to her daughter.

		Eager to find out what's waiting for you, you hurry down the hallway and [pc.step] through the door to [nyanmum.namePos] bedroom. As you enter, you immediately see that the lights have been dimmed in order to create a more intimate atmosphere. Underfoot, a trail of red rose petals have been scattered over the cream-coloured carpet, leading to the large double bed on the opposite side of the room. The rest of your surroundings aren't of any particular interest to you from this point on, as your attention is very quickly drawn to the two cat-girls sitting on the edge of the bed.

		The outcome of your decision to ask for [nyanmum.namePos] 'kinky' idea is immediately apparent, as Nyan and [nyanmum.name] are both wearing crotchless thongs and open-cup bras, leaving their breasts and pussies completely exposed. Around each of their necks, they're wearing a bell collar that's colour-coordinated with their lingerie, which for Nyan is light pink and for [nyanmum.name] is royal purple. Finishing off the look, each of them have a fancy ribbon tied around their tails, which is white for Nyan and black for [nyanmum.name].

		As you let the door swing shut behind you, Nyan and her mother stand up from the edge of the bed, before stepping forwards to meet you half-way across the room. Confidently flaunting her [nyanmum.breastSize], [nyanmum.cupSize]-cup breasts, [nyanmum.name] starts stripping you naked as she moans, [nyanmum.speech(I hope you like our outfits, [pc.name]...
