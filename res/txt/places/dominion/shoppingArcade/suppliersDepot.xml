		The establishment before you, once boarded up and closed, is now quite clearly open for business.
		 The words 'Supplier Depot; bulk clothing sales and storage' have recently been re-painted in bold yellow lettering above the entrance, and there's a little 'open for business' sign hanging in the doorway.
		 The boarding that once covered the wide glass windows has all been torn down, allowing you to see into the clean, well-lit reception area.
	</p>
	<p>
		From where you're standing, you can see that there's a lesser mouse-girl sitting behind the reception's front desk.
		 A few of the Depot's clients are talking with each other as they relax on a trio of plain green sofas.
		 You wonder if you should step inside, or continue on your way to elsewhere in the Shopping Arcade...

		The establishment before you is one of the few in the Shopping Arcade that's not open for business, but you're sure that all of that will change very soon.
		 The words 'Supplier Depot; bulk clothing sales and storage' have recently been re-painted in bold yellow lettering above the entrance, but the windows are all still boarded up, and the 'closed' sign remains hanging in the doorway.
	</p>
	<p>
		Peeking through some of the gaps in the boarding, you see numerous workmen painting the walls and fitting new lights into the ceiling.
		 You know that it won't be long before this place re-opens, which will allow Nyan to stock enchanted clothing once again.

	<p>
		The establishment before you is one of the few in the Shopping Arcade that's not open for business.
		 The words 'Supplier Depot; bulk clothing sales and storage' are written in inviting yellow lettering above the entrance, the wide glass windows are all boarded up, and there's a little 'closed' sign hanging in the doorway.
		 The name suggests that this place used to deal primarily in bulk transactions for other stores, and so even if it were still open, it wouldn't be a suitable place for you to shop at.
	</p>
	<p>
		Peeking through some of the gaps in the boarding, you're surprised to see that a couple of the lights are still on inside.
		 You reason that it's probably for some unseen workmen refurbishing the back rooms, and decide to move on to find a more interesting store.

		The establishment before you is one of the few in the Shopping Arcade that's not open for business.
		 The words 'Supplier Depot; bulk clothing sales and storage' are written in inviting yellow lettering above the entrance, but the windows are all boarded up, and there's a little 'closed' sign hanging in the doorway.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is definitely the place that Nyan told you about, and, peering through some of the gaps in the boarding, you see that a couple of the lights are still on inside.
		 Moving over to the door, you give it an experimental push, and discover that despite the sign, it's not locked.
		 You wonder if you should enter the Depot now, or come back at another time...

	<htmlContent tag="RECEPTION_EMPTY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		From the long, wooden desk that runs parallel to the back wall, you can safely assume that this room was once used as a reception area.
		 Apart from that one piece of furniture, and a couple of empty crates stacked near the entrance, the place is completely empty.
		 The boards covering the windows block out most of the light from the Shopping Arcade, leaving this area illuminated primarily by two dim arcane-powered bulbs dangling from the ceiling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides the one that you just used to make your entrance, there's only one other door that leads out of this room, which is positioned behind the dust-covered reception desk.
		 The words 'Private: Staff Only' are printed on a metal sign that's affixed to it, but you're not sure if that's a recent addition, or a remnant of the time when this place was open to the public.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="RECEPTION_EMPTY_STAFF_DOOR"><![CDATA[

	<htmlContent tag="RECEPTION_EMPTY_STAFF_DOOR_UNLOCKING"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You walk up to the door, flinching a little as one of the floorboards loudly creaks beneath your feet.
		 Stopping in your tracks, you wait for a moment to find out if anyone's heard your approach.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thankfully, there's nothing to be heard but silence, and after a minute, you continue towards the door.
		 Placing your [pc.hand] on the doorknob, you twist down and push forwards, finding that this door, much like the entrance, has been left unlocked.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you open the door, you find yourself looking down a long, dimly lit corridor, which appears to stretch to the very rear of the building.
		 On either side, you see several wide openings linking this passage to the Depot's storage areas.
		 The thing that draws your attention the most, however, is the the sound of a male's deep laughter echoing out from a room at the far end of the corridor.
		 You realise that there's no possibility of the occupants of this building hearing your arrival when they're making such a racket, and you confidently push the door fully open, leaving you with a clear path to the rest of the building.

		The long, wooden reception desk that runs parallel to the back wall has been sanded down and polished since the first time you saw it.
		 The walls, ceiling, and floor have all undergone a complete refurbishment, and where once there was a stack of empty boxes, you now see a few of the Depot's new clients talking with one other as they relax on a trio of plain green sofas.
	</p>
	<p>
		The brown-haired mouse-girl who's sitting behind the reception desk watches you through a pair of steel-framed glasses, and as you look her way, she smiles and calls out a greeting, before continuing with the paperwork in front of her.

		As you approach the end of the corridor, you hear the deep rumble of a pair of male voices, occasionally interspersed with a roar of laughter, growing louder and louder.
		 You discover that the noise is coming from behind a frosted-glass door labelled as 'Supplier Offices'.
		 A long list of names is displayed beneath this, and you see that with the exception of the entry at the very bottom, reading 'Wolfgang & Karl', all the rest have been crossed out. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Seeing no alternative but to make a bold entrance, you reach for the handle of the door, and, pushing it open, you step forwards.
		 Although the room that you enter was once quite clearly a waiting-area for the offices located down the short corridor in front of you, several desks, tables, sofas, and chairs have been dragged into this area in order to turn it into a haphazard hangout.
		 Numerous empty bottles of the beer 'Canine Crush' are scattered about all over the area, and countless empty pizza-boxes and takeaway cartons are piled up in one corner of the room.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most striking feature in front of you, however, is the pair of black-and-brown-furred greater dobermann-boys, who both instantly push their chairs back and jump to their feet as you enter.
		 The one closest to you is a little taller and more muscular than the other, and although they're both wearing black jeans, shirts, and heavy work-boots, this larger dobermann is sporting a pair of gold-framed aviators.
		 It's this larger of the two who's the first to speak, and he adopts a menacing pose as he growls,

		 The long list of names beneath that title have all been restored, and you can't help but smirk as you see that the pair 'Wolfgang & Karl' have been put at the very top this time around.

		Knowing that this area is now safe for you to enter, you reach for the handle of the door, and, pushing it open, you step forwards into a very neat and orderly waiting area.

		 Finally, you read the plaque 'Wolfgang & Karl: Security'.

		 You let out a small [pc.moan] as Wolfgang presses up against you, grinding his huge bulge against your [pc.leg] as both he and Karl start to grope to fondle your body.
	</p>
	<p>
		[karl.speech(I'm using [pc.her] mouth,)]
		 Karl growls as he reaches up to take hold of your shoulders, before snarling into your ear,

	<p>
		You look back to see Wolfgang kneel down behind you, and can't help but gasp as he grabs hold of your [pc.hips+] and roughly pulls you into his groin.
		 Karl drops to his knees in front of you, and, turning your head forwards, you find yourself staring at the huge bulge between his legs.
	</p>
	<p>
		[wolfgang.speech(Ready for a rough fucking, Enforcer slut?)]
		 Wolfgang growls, causing you to let out another [pc.moan] in response...

		 Looking up and you and panting, Wolfgang begs,

	</p>
	<p>
		Smirking, you step forwards, looking down at the defeated pair as you make your demands known,

		 You could leave and let Nyan know of your success right away, or perhaps take this opportunity to have a little fun...
