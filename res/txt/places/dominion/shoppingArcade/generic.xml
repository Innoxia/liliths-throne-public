A wide, marble-floored walkway stretches out before you, and on either side, huge glass windows proudly display a wide variety of different goods for sale.

		While most of the shops in the arcade have at least three large windows in which to display their goods, the store that you find yourself standing in front of has just the one, making it the smallest shop in all of the arcade. Looking through this solitary sheet of glass, you see that the store's gloomy interior is filled with all sorts of old furniture and miscellaneous items. This odd-looking arrangement is explained by an amphora-shaped sign hanging above the shop's entrance, which bears the words 'Antiques & Collectables'.

Finding that the interior isn't quite as dimly lit as it appeared to be when looking in from the outside, you're able to see that what the store lacks in width, it more than makes up for in depth, with the back wall being a considerable distance from where you're currently standing.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you join several other customers in ambling throughout the store, you end up passing an eclectic mix of creaky old furniture, obsolete arcane instruments, and all manner of outdated miscellaneous items. While they may be of some interest to dedicated collectors, these curious artefacts really are of no use to you.

		You aren't here to shop for antiques, however, and as you walk down the narrow aisles formed between piles of old furniture, you look out for any possible sign of Scarlett's presence.

		As there's no obvious sign of Scarlett anywhere in the store, you head over to the cat-girl employee standing behind the counter and ask her if she knows anything about the harpy you're looking for. As you mention your quarry's name, the cat-girl nervously glances over towards a nearby door marked as 'staff only', before revealing, [style.speechFeminine(Yes, she's a slave here, although she's not been allowed out of the storage room since she attacked that one customer...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Relieved to discover that the harpy is close at hand, you ask the cat-girl if you could speak to Scarlett's owner. Happily nodding her head, she says, [style.speechFeminine(If you're here to do something about her, I'm sure the boss would want to talk to you. He's back there in the storage room at the moment; I think he's trying to train Scarlett to not be so rude to customers...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Asking you to wait for just a moment, the cat-girl quickly steps over to the door, before pushing it ajar and poking her head into the room beyond, calling, [style.speechFeminine(Laurence! There's someone here who wants to talk to you about Scarlett!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		A flustered-sounding voice calls back, [style.speechMasculine(Thank goodness! The owner of that slave shop must have changed their mind about giving me a refund! Send them in!)]

		Holding the door open, the cat-girl waves you on through, waiting until you've [pc.stepped] forwards into the storage room before quickly returning to her place behind the counter. As the door swings shut behind you, the room's two occupants turn to face you.

As the raven-harpy catches sight of you, she narrows her [scarlett.eyeColour] eyes and sneers, [scarlett.speech(Well, if it isn't the cunt who sold me!

		Ignoring Scarlett's sneers, you explain to her owner that while you're not here to offer him a refund, you <i>are</i> interested in buying her freedom. As you reveal this fact, the insolent harpy steps in front of the squirrel-boy, cutting him off as she rudely asks, [scarlett.speech(Why the fuck would you want to do that?! Is this some kind of fucking trick?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[style.speechMasculine(Scarlett, please, could you just-)] Laurence starts to say, but the harpy simply turns around and shoots him a withering look, which turns out to be enough to immediately silence him.
	</p>
	<p>
		Realising that you're not going to get anywhere with Scarlett acting in this manner, you tell her that the reason you're here to free her is so that Helena can employ her as her personal assistant. Upon hearing her old matriarch's name, the harpy lets out a defeated sigh and collapses down into a nearby chair, much to the dismay of Laurence, who objects, [style.speechMasculine(Scarlett! Please, don't sit on that! It's a one of a kind, and was made specially for Lyssieth herself!)]

That salesman told me that she was well trained and always eager to work! I'm never buying any slaves ever again!)]
	</p>

		Pointing out to him that you'll be doing him a favour by taking Scarlett off his hands, you ask Laurence how much he's going to be asking for her. Letting out a weary sigh, he reveals, [style.speechMasculine(I paid twenty thousand for her, but I'm so desperate to get rid of her that I'll let you have her for just half that.

Handing these papers over to the harpy herself, you tell her that while she's now free, her matriarch is expecting to see her back in Slaver Alley right away.

As the two of you start haggling over her value, Scarlett loudly complains, [scarlett.speech(Can you two hurry the fuck up? I want to get out of this dump as quickly as possible.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning to face his slave, no doubt with the intention of asking her to be quiet, the squirrel-boy instead lets out a distressed cry as he sees that Scarlett has put her bird-like feet up on the antique coffee table sitting in front of her. Clearly not at all bothered by her owner's reaction, Scarlett sinks down into the chair, and as she does so, her talons make a loud scratching noise as they run over the table's wooden surface.
