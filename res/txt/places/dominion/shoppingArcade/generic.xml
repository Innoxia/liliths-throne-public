			The fear of falling prey to the ongoing arcane storm's effects has caused the vast majority of Dominion's residents to take shelter. As a result, the streets that you find yourself walking down are all eerily quiet, with only the occasional demon to be seen wandering about.

				Travelling further up the road, you notice that there are curious amount of demons walking around in this area, and, what's more, you notice that most of them are carrying shopping bags of some sort or another. The cause of this unusual gathering is soon made apparent, as up ahead you see a huge shopping centre, with yet more demons loitering around the ornate entranceway.

				As you approach, you take a good look at the massive building, noting that its style is very reminiscent of that of a grand Victorian shopping arcade. From what you can see through the entrance's glass doors, it looks as though the shops inside are all still [style.colourGood(open)] for business, despite the storm currently raging overhead. Sure enough, taking a look over to one side of the entrance, you notice a sign proclaiming that [style.colourMinorGood(all shops within the arcade are open from 06:00 to 22:00)].

				You wonder if you should take this opportunity to go and do some shopping...

Just as these signs promised, you soon catch sight of a huge shopping centre, and after just a few moments more, you find yourself standing outside the ornate entranceway.

		You find yourself standing in the entrance to the shopping arcade. A wide, marble-floored walkway stretches out before you, and on either side, huge glass windows proudly display a wide variety of different goods for sale. Looking up to the two-story-high ceiling, you see that the entire arcade is enclosed by a long, glass archway, offering protection not only from the wind and rain, but also shielding anyone below from the effects of an arcane storm.

			Busy crowds of shoppers jostle amongst each other as they travel between the many shops found within the arcade. Their chatter reverberates off the windows and walls on either side to create a loud, energetic atmosphere all around you.
		#ELSE
			As all of the shops found within the arcade are currently closed, the entire place is almost completely deserted. The only person other than yourself in this area is a wolf-boy security guard, who keeps a close watch on anyone entering or leaving the arcade.

		There are several touristy-looking information boards placed nearby, and, after consulting one, you feel confident that you could easily find your way to any of the more interesting stores.

			Busy throngs of the arcade's patrons jostle to and fro, and you often find yourself having to push your way through idling crowds that inexplicably gather right in the middle of your path. Their chatter reverberates off the windows and walls on either side of you to create a loud, energetic atmosphere all the way through the arcade.

			As all of the shops in the arcade are currently closed, the entire place is almost completely deserted. The only other people that you see are the occasional patrolling security guard or curious citizen taking a leisurely stroll through the area.
