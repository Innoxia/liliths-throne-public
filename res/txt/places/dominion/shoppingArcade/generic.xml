		Tucked away in one corner of the Shopping Arcade, the restaurant 'The Oaken Glade' proudly displays its name in flowing gold lettering above its front door. The establishment's large windows allow you to look in on an incredible scene; the vast interior has been manipulated by some form of arcane-powered illusion, making it appear as though the restaurant is a portal directly into the middle of a summer-time forest clearing.
		#IF(game.isDayTime())

		The scene is so fascinating that it's able to draw in a continuous stream of passersby. Walking up to the menu displayed next to the entrance, these potential customers are almost all immediately turned away by what they see. Moving up to take a look yourself, you see the reason for their swift departure; the cheapest item on the menu is a three-course meal that's priced at almost one-thousand flames. The wine menu is even more outrageously expensive, and you imagine that it would be all too easy for a couple to generate an evening's bill of close to ten thousand flames.

		The glass of the window beside the front door has been elaborately etched with decorative, flowing patterns, and in the middle of this, there's some writing which declares this restaurant to be

		While most of the shops in the arcade have at least three large windows in which to display their goods, the store that you find yourself standing in front of has just the one, making it the smallest shop in all of the arcade. Looking through this solitary sheet of glass, you see that the store's gloomy interior is filled with all sorts of old furniture and miscellaneous items. This odd-looking arrangement is explained by an amphora-shaped sign hanging above the shop's entrance, which bears the words 'Antiques & Collectables'.

	<p>
		As you join several other customers in ambling throughout the store, you end up passing an eclectic mix of creaky old furniture, obsolete arcane instruments, and all manner of outdated miscellaneous items.

He's back there in the storage room at the moment; I think he's trying to train Scarlett to not be so rude to customers...)]

		Realising that you're not going to get anywhere with Scarlett acting in this manner, you tell her that the reason you're here to free her is so that Helena can employ her as her personal assistant. Upon hearing her old matriarch's name, the harpy lets out a defeated sigh and collapses down into a nearby chair, much to the dismay of Laurence, who objects, [style.speechMasculine(Scarlett!
