		While most of the shops in the arcade have at least three large windows in which to display their goods, the store that you find yourself standing in front of has just the one, making it the smallest shop in all of the arcade. Looking through this solitary sheet of glass, you see that the store's gloomy interior is filled with all sorts of old furniture and miscellaneous items.

	<p>
		As you join several other customers in ambling throughout the store, you end up passing an eclectic mix of creaky old furniture, obsolete arcane instruments, and all manner of outdated miscellaneous items.

As you mention your quarry's name, the cat-girl nervously glances over towards a nearby door marked as 'staff only', before revealing, [style.speechFeminine(Yes, she's a slave here, although she's not been allowed out of the storage room since she attacked that one customer...)]
	</p>

		Relieved to discover that the harpy is close at hand, you ask the cat-girl if you could speak to Scarlett's owner. Happily nodding her head, she says, [style.speechFeminine(If you're here to do something about her, I'm sure the boss would want to talk to you. He's back there in the storage room at the moment; I think he's trying to train Scarlett to not be so rude to customers...)]

		Asking you to wait for just a moment, the cat-girl quickly steps over to the door, before pushing it ajar and poking her head into the room beyond, calling, [style.speechFeminine(Laurence! There's someone here who wants to talk to you about Scarlett!)]

As you reveal this fact, the insolent harpy steps in front of the squirrel-boy, cutting him off as she rudely asks, [scarlett.speech(Why the fuck would you want to do that?! Is this some kind of fucking trick?!)]

		[style.speechMasculine(Scarlett, please, could you just-)] Laurence starts to say, but the harpy simply turns around and shoots him a withering look, which turns out to be enough to immediately silence him.

	<p>
		Realising that you're not going to get anywhere with Scarlett acting in this manner, you tell her that the reason you're here to free her is so that Helena can employ her as her personal assistant. Upon hearing her old matriarch's name, the harpy lets out a defeated sigh and collapses down into a nearby chair, much to the dismay of Laurence, who objects, [style.speechMasculine(Scarlett! Please, don't sit on that! It's a one of a kind, and was made specially for Lyssieth herself!)]

		Pointing out to him that you'll be doing him a favour by taking Scarlett off his hands, you ask Laurence how much he's going to be asking for her. Letting out a weary sigh, he reveals, [style.speechMasculine(I paid twenty thousand for her, but I'm so desperate to get rid of her that I'll let you have her for just half that.

		Turning to face his slave, no doubt with the intention of asking her to be quiet, the squirrel-boy instead lets out a distressed cry as he sees that Scarlett has put her bird-like feet up on the antique coffee table sitting in front of her.
