	<p>
		Not wanting to wait a moment longer than is necessary, you quickly tell Helena that you've purchased the golden paint she asked for. Letting a slight smile settle on her face, the matriarch ushers you forwards with a gentle swish of one wing, before commanding, [helena.speech(Step forwards and show it to me without delay.)]

	<htmlContent tag="ROMANCE_SHOP_CORE_2_NO_PAINT"><![CDATA[

		You reluctantly admit to Helena that you haven't yet purchased the golden paint she asked for. With a dismissive swipe of her wing, she coldly declares,

			 [helena.speech(That being the case, if you are not interested in purchasing the slaves I have for sale, then it would please me if you were to immediately get out of my sight.)]

	<p>
		Pushing open the front door and entering Helena's shop, you once again see the gorgeous harpy sitting behind the shop's counter. With a mild look of satisfaction on her angelic face, she offers you some rare praise, [helena.speech(I was most pleased to see that you'd done as I asked when I arrived here this morning. Well done, [pc.name].)]
	</p>
	<p>
		By now knowing what's expecting of you, and not wanting to do anything to ruin the haughty matriarch's apparent good mood, you quickly reply, [pc.speech(Thank you, Helena.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(I suppose I should inform you that I am not planning on stocking any more slaves until after all this renovation work has been completed,)] she reveals, [helena.speech(If you were still in the market for purchasing slaves of your own, then you have my permission to buy them from someone other than me.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You don't recall ever being told that you weren't allowed to buy slaves from stores other than Helena's, but decide to keep that fact to yourself as she continues, [helena.speech(Today you will be painting the exterior of my store. Take those cans of white paint and whatever other supplies you need outside.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(pc.hasCompanion(scarlett))
			Dismissively gesturing towards the supplies sitting near to the front entrance, Helena shoots you and [scarlett.name] a piercing look, making it very clear that she expects you complete this task as quickly as possible. Not wanting to disappoint, you and your [scarlett.companion] hurry over to the entrance and carry the supplies out in front of her shop.

		#ENDIF
		 After placing the last can down on the ground, you turn back towards the entrance only to see the regal matriarch exiting her shop. Once again locking the door behind her, she turns to face you and proclaims, [helena.speech(There's really nothing more for me to do here, so I shall be taking the rest of the day off once again. I expect all of the woodwork painted and looking absolutely perfect before the end of the day. I am also expecting a delivery of furniture some time within the next few hours, so you shall not leave until you have overseen the unloading of it. Do I make myself understood?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Yes, Helena,)] you once again find yourself replying, before politely pointing out the obvious fact that the front door is locked, and that you have no way of opening it for the deliverymen.
	</p>
	<p>
		This detail clearly seems to have slipped Helena's mind, for she lets out an almost inaudible sigh in frustration, before beckoning you over to stand in front of her. Hurrying forwards, you come to a halt right in front of the dazzlingly-beautiful matriarch, who swiftly passes you a spare key, saying, [helena.speech(This shall be all you require. Once you have finished your work, you are to lock up and post it back through the letterbox.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Without waiting for your reply, the beautiful matriarch turns her back on you, before taking a few graceful, skipping steps and launching herself into the air. With several sweeps of her pristine, white wings, she quickly gains altitude, before wheeling around and flying off in the direction of the Harpy Nests once again.

		Pushing open the front door, you once again find yourself stepping inside Helena's shop. Unlike the previous times you've been here, however, the harpy matriarch isn't sitting behind the counter, and is instead regally perched on one of the new sofas. As she notices your entrance, she puts down the fashion magazine she was reading, before beckoning you forwards with a wave of one of her elegant wings.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you move over to where the beautiful harpy is sitting, she offers you an uncharacteristic smile and sincerely states, [helena.speech(I must say that you are exceeding the expectations I had of you, [pc.name]. Not only have you done an excellent job of painting the front of this establishment, but you've ensured that all of this furniture was delivered here without issue.
		#IF(pc.hasCompanion(scarlett))
			 I will permit you and [scarlett.name] to sit with me for a moment.
		#ELSE
			 I will permit you to sit with me for a moment.

	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Thank you, Helena,)] you say, knowing that all of your hard work could be undone if you don't show the haughty matriarch the respect she's accustomed to.
		#IF(pc.isTaur())
			 As you have the lower body of [pc.a_legRace], you're unable to sit on the sofa opposite Helena, and so make do with simply kneeling down on the plush rug beside her.
		#ELSE
			 Following another sweeping gesture from one of her flawless white wings, you sit down on the stylish sofa opposite to Helena.
		#ENDIF
		#IF(pc.hasCompanion(scarlett))
			 Following your lead, [scarlett.name] thanks [scarlett.her] old matriarch before sitting down next to you, trying [scarlett.her] best not to do anything to draw Helena's ire.
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(It would appear as though the commoners are beginning to take notice,)] the harpy observes, giving the briefest of nods towards the shop's large windows. Sure enough, as you look across, you see that a pretty squirrel-girl has stopped to take a closer look at the store, and as she peers through the windows and catches sight of Helena, she does a double-take and starts to stare at her in awe. Letting out an almost imperceptible sigh, the harpy reveals, [helena.speech(Thanks to my dear Scarlett's hard work this establishment has, up until now, had quite the poor reputation. As such, word of my presence here has thus far not spread, but it would appear as though that is about to change.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(That will be good for your business though, won't it?)] you quite rightly observe.
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(I suppose so, yes,)] the harpy admits, [helena.speech(but the attention I often end up attracting can get quite tiring. In any case, there's no stopping it now, so with your help, I shall make it official.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Rising to her feet, the regal harpy elegantly sweeps one of her delicate wings towards the door. Following her lead, you also stand up, and turn to see that she's pointing towards the solitary can of golden paint which you'd previously purchased. Showing you a little more respect than you'd become accustomed to receiving from her, Helena asks, [helena.speech(If you would be so kind, I would ask of you to take that paint outside. I shall accompany you and oversee the completion of your next task.)]

		Pushing open the front door, you once again find yourself stepping inside Helena's shop. Looking across to the other side of the room, you see the beautiful harpy matriarch perfectly postured upon one of the designer sofas. Noticing your entry, and seeing that [scarlett.name] is with you, she beckons the two of you towards her with a graceful sweep of one of her white-feathered wings.
	</p>

		 As you sit down beside your slave, Helena flashes you a slight smile and states, [helena.speech(My offer for the purchase of my dear Scarlett stands at [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] flames. I am sure that I need not remind you, but you will either accept my offer, or else I will have no choice but to close this business down.)]
	</p>

		#IF(scarlett.isLikesPlayer())
			Looking across at your slave, you see her cast an affectionate glance your way, as though [scarlett.sheIs] trying to make it known that [scarlett.she]'d rather stay by your side. Picking up on the fact that the [scarlett.race] is quite fond of you, Helena kindly offers, [helena.speech(I have no intention of keeping you from seeing one another; you will always be welcome to visit my dear Scarlett at any time.)]

		Knowing that the offer of [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] flames must be close to double [scarlett.namePos] actual value, you realise that Helena's offer is extremely generous. Sensing your slight hesitation as you think things over, the beautiful harpy pointedly says, [helena.speech(If you are to refuse me here, [pc.name], then please understand that I shall not be pleased.

		To begin with, the sheer audacity of what Helena is suggesting leaves you struggling to comprehend her words. As she finishes talking, however, you're left with no doubt that she means for <i>you</i> to pay <i>her</i> ten thousand flames, seemingly for the honour of being allowed to help her...

		Doing as you're told, you head into the back room in order to retrieve the box of supplies which Helena is talking about. Surprisingly enough, this room is almost as large as the main shop floor itself, but despite its size, the only pieces of furniture to be seen in here are a couple of basic wooden chairs and an old table which looks to have seen better days. Sitting upon this table, there's a large cardboard box, which must be the one you're here to fetch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Picking up the box, which turns out to be surprisingly heavy, you walk back out into the main shop and set it down next to where Helena is sitting. Gesturing at the box with one wing, the matriarch commands, [helena.speech(Open it and stack the contents by the front door.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Once again doing as you're told, you first move the box over to the shop's entrance, before opening it and starting to unpack the contents. It's immediately apparent as to why it was so heavy, as it contains no less than six large cans of white paint, along with several paint brushes, rollers, and stacks of sandpaper. Once you're done, you return to Helena, who reveals, [helena.speech(I have been assured that there are enough supplies in there to completely strip and repaint the store's frontage. The only thing which is missing is the golden paint required for the replacement of the name 'Scarlett's Shop'. You will obtain this paint for me.)]

		It only takes a moment for Helena to find what it she was looking for, and with a graceful swish of her white-feathered wing, she throws what looks to be a promotional brochure down onto the counter-top in front of you. Opening it up onto a page which she's previously bookmarked, the harpy points to an image of a can of paint, saying, [helena.speech(This is the one you will purchase. Make sure that it's the 'Purple-star' brand; I will not accept anything less than the very best.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking a closer look at the brochure, you see that it's advertising the home-improvements store, 'Argus's DIY Depot'. The can of golden paint which Helena is pointing to is marked up at the unbelievable price of [#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] flames. Advertised lower down, you see that there's a cheaper, 'Bronze-star' branded alternative, which costs just [#SPECIAL_PARSE_1] flames. As you start to wonder if you could get away with buying that cheaper one instead, Helena snaps the brochure shut and informs you, [helena.speech(The store which you need to go to is a short way south of Slaver Alley. You're to go there as soon as you possibly can, buy this paint, and then return here to me. Do you understand?)]

		With a dismissive wave of her wing, the harpy indicates that she's finished speaking with you. As you're obviously not going to be given the money with which to buy this paint, there's nothing more for you to do but turn around and head out of Helena's store...

		Much to your delight, you see that your work has made a huge difference, as the pure white brilliance of the freshly-applied paint now makes Helena's store really stand out from those around it. In fact, several passersby are already looking your way as they walk past, and you hear some of them asking one another if that shop had always been there. More than satisfied with the results of your hard work, you set about cleaning up what little mess you've made, before looking around to see if there's any sign of the furniture delivery company's arrival.
	</p>
	<p>
		Almost as though it were preordained, you immediately catch sight of a pair of tall, buff centaurs walking directly towards you. Even from this distance you can see the huge muscles of their feral horse bodies flexing and contracting as they heave a huge, four-wheeled cart behind them. As they approach, you see that the large canvas covering which has been erected over the top of this wagon is proudly bearing the name 'Dominion Express', which, along with the accompanying logo of a winged package, reveals the fact that this must be the delivery company you were waiting for.
	</p>
	<p>
		As they come to a halt outside of Helena's store, you notice that these two huge centaurs are completely naked, save for the thick gold slave collars locked around their necks. Keeping their gaze fixed straight ahead of them, these obedient slaves remain completely motionless, and just as you're wondering what they're waiting for, a feminine voice suddenly calls out from under the cart's cloth covering, [natalya.speech(Oh, we've arrived? Good boys!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The clopping sound of hoofs hitting pavement rings out from behind the cart as a slim, feminine [natalya.race] nimbly leaps out from beneath the canvas covering. As she quickly trots up to the entrance of Helena's shop, you're able to see that while the slaves under her command are almost
		#IF(game.isMetricSizes())
			 two and a half metres
		#ELSE
			 eight feet
		#ENDIF
		 tall, the lithe, lilac-skinned demon is barely pushing past
		#IF(game.isMetricSizes())
			 a hundred and seventy centimetres from head to hoof.
		#ELSE
			 five and a half feet from head to hoof.
		#ENDIF
		 In another contrast to her naked slaves, this [natalya.race] is dressed to impress, as on the upper, humanoid part of her body, a very smart feminine blazer and shirt are restraining her round, [natalya.cupSize]-cup breasts, while a large, black skirt conceals whatever genitalia she might have at the rear of her feral horse's body. Her silken, black hair is tied up into a smart bun, which is being held in place by a pair of royal-purple hair sticks. Perched on the bridge of her cute feminine nose, she's wearing a pair of black, thick-rimmed glasses, and as she realises that the store in front of her is closed, she rolls her grey-green eyes and tuts, [natalya.speech(This is most unsatisfactory. I was assured that there'd be somebody here to receive me...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As the events in front of you have unfolded so quickly, you haven't had the opportunity to attract this small [natalya.race]'s attention, but as she turns away from the locked door, you realise that now's the moment to introduce yourself...

		Approaching the [natalya.race], you introduce yourself and explain that you've been instructed by Helena to receive a delivery of furniture for her. From the moment she caught sight of you, an arrogant smirk had settled on this demon's pretty face, and as you finish explaining the situation, she proudly boasts, [natalya.speech(My name is Natalya Loviennemartu, and I hold the prestigious title of 'Stable Mistress' at the fine institution known throughout Lilith's Realm as 'Dominion Express'. Due to the exceptional circumstance of receiving a contract from Helena herself, I thought it prudent to oversee this delivery in person. Please inform her that I have arrived!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you reveal that Helena has already left and will not be returning today, the small [natalya.race]'s smirk is quickly replaced by an irritated scowl. Letting out a loud tutting noise, she impatiently produces a trailing paper receipt from out of one of her blazer's pockets, before rudely thrusting it into your [pc.hands] and declaring, [natalya.speech(This is the list of everything that's to be delivered today. As you can no doubt see, there's plenty to be unloaded, so hurry up and get that door unlocked, then I'll command my big, strong boys... ~Ahem!~ That is, then I shall have the slaves here get to work.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you quickly scan over the list which Natalya just passed to you, it becomes immediately apparent that there is a huge amount of furniture for the centaurs to unload. Seeing no reason to delay, you unlock and open the front door, while Natalya proudly trots over to the side of the nearest centaur and starts to unbuckle him from the cart's harness. As she does this, you can't help but notice the way in which the [natalya.race]'s delicate fingers stroke over her slave's body, and as she walks around to the second centaur, she makes a show of flicking her tail in their direction. Quite clearly being extremely well-trained, the centaurs stoically ignore their owner's playful teasing, and as soon as Natalya gives them the word, they silently set about unloading the furniture from the back of the cart.

		Obviously having been previously instructed on where each piece of furniture is to be placed, the two centaurs get on with their task without requiring any further orders, which seems to suit their owner very well, as the arrogant [natalya.race] seems more than happy to simply stand back and watch her slaves work. Not showing any sign of wanting to engage you in conversation, Natalya hungrily gazes at her slaves' muscular bodies as they heave piece after piece of heavy furniture into Helena's shop. It only takes a few minutes of this before the pretty [natalya.race] starts biting her lip and audibly panting in excitement. Staring longingly at the centaurs' huge, sheathed cocks and massive, dangling balls, she seems to forget that you're still standing there as she mutters under her breath, [natalya.speech(That's my good boys... You'll get your reward later...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At the exact same moment, both you and Natalya suddenly become aware that there's a thick stream of slimy precum drooling down to form a steadily-growing pool on the paving stones beneath her feral horse body. Pretending as though nothing is wrong, she quickly trots around to the rear of the cart, before grabbing something out of the back of it and arrogantly shouting out to you, [natalya.speech(Stay right there and make sure my slaves do not require anything. I will be back in just a moment!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Concealing the item she's just grabbed behind her body, the lithe [natalya.race] nimbly canters off down the alleyway beside Helena's shop, before turning a corner and disappearing from sight. Knowing that the alleyway leads to nothing but a dead end, you could always follow after Natalya and see what she's getting up to. Then again, if you don't want to find out what she's packing beneath that large skirt of hers, you could always do as she says and remain here until she returns...

		Muttering thanks under your breath that you don't have to spend a single moment more in the presence of that arrogant demon,
		#IF(pc.hasCompanions())
			 you spend your time enjoying the company of [com.namePos] as the two of you wait for the centaurs to finish their task.
		#ELSE
			 you spend your time loitering about near the cart as you wait for the centaurs to finish their task.
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Watching the two slaves carry all sorts of furniture into Helena's shop, you can't help but be impressed by their superb efficiency. Without ever uttering a single word to one another, they get on with their work in perfect harmony, and after just fifteen minutes they've unloaded every last item. Seeing no sign of their owner, the centaurs obediently return to stand side-by-side in front of the now-empty cart, stoically staring straight ahead as they await Natalya's return.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just a moment later, the small [natalya.race] steps out from the alleyway, and with a satisfied, smug look on her face, she trots up to where her slaves are standing and sets about strapping them into their harnesses. As Natalya passes you by, you smell a strong, heady musk following in her wake, and as she once again teases her slaves by flicking her horse-like tail in their direction, one of the centaurs starts restlessly pawing the ground. Putting an immediate stop to this excitable behaviour by flashing him a furious glare, the [natalya.race] tightly buckles up his harness before finally turning to you and rudely declaring, [natalya.speech(You're a good [pc.girl], having waited here as I instructed. Now you will sign the receipt I gave to you and we shall be on our way.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Producing a pen from out of one of her blazer's pockets, Natalya thrusts it into your [pc.hands] and impatiently crosses her arms as she waits for you to sign the receipt. Having been keeping a close eye on the two centaurs the entire time they were unpacking the furniture, you're sure that nothing is damaged, and so you do as the [natalya.race] says and put your signature on the dotted line. The moment you finish, Natalya abruptly snatches both the pen and paper from you, before tearing off the carbon copy and handing it back to you. Reaching into her pocket once more, she produces a business card and carelessly tosses it for you to catch as she declares, [natalya.speech(Our business here is finished. As you're able to follow my commands, I suppose that you show a glimmer of potential and so could be considered for employment at Dominion Express. Our address is on that business card; I expect to see you there at some point in the future.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, the haughty [natalya.race] trots off to the back of her cart, making a point of going the long way around so as to walk in front of her centaurs and flick her tail in their direction one last time. As she passes, you hear her tease under her breath, [natalya.speech(One of you will be getting some of this tonight...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Gracefully leaping into the back of the wagon, Natalya calls out for her slaves to get moving, and with a rumble of wheels and creak of leather, they turn around and speed off in the direction they came. Looking down at the business card in your [pc.hand], you read that their company, 'Dominion Express', is located in Dominion's Warehouse District, so if you wanted to seek out Natalya and find out more about her job offer, that's where you'd need to head. For now, however, you need to lock up Helena's shop...

	<p>
		With Natalya and her centaurs having departed, you decide to head inside Helena's shop and take a quick look around. Although it's possible to see the new interior by looking through the large glass windows, upon entering the store you still find yourself completely blown away by how different it looks. The barren shop floor from an hour earlier has been transformed into what now looks like an exclusive VIP lounge, with plush designer sofas and elegant coffee tables tastefully placed here and there in little self-contained clusters.
	</p>
	<p>
		Heading over to the back room from which you retrieved the painting supplies, you're amazed to discover that it's now a combined storage and staff room. A long, stylish counter runs alongside the left-hand wall, and holds everything from coffee and tea machines to glass-fronted fridges ready to be stocked with cold drinks. The other side of the room is blocked from sight behind several free-standing room dividers, and after peering around them, you discover that the area beyond is home to several rows of shelving units, as well as a half dozen metal posts, which have been securely bolted down to the floor. Noticing that there's a large metal ring attached to each one, you realise that the purpose of these posts is so that slaves can be chained up to them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having finished your brief inspection, you swiftly exit Helena's store, before locking the front door and posting the keys through the letterbox, as instructed. Once again finding yourself in the position where there's nothing to do except leave and 
			#IF(game.getDayOfWeek()==DOW_FRIDAY)
				 [style.colourMinorGood(return on Monday morning)],

		#ELSE
			 and with the two centaurs showing no sign of requiring any help, you slip down the alley and follow after her.
		#ENDIF
		 Quickly approaching the end of the passageway, you peer around the corner to see that there's a very lewd scene taking place before you.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first thing that grabs your attention is the fact that Natalya has not only pulled up her large skirt, but is also flicking her tail to one side, which gives you an unobstructed view of her rear end. Despite what her feminine appearance might lead people to assume, you're able to see that there's no sign of a pussy between this small [natalya.race]'s legs. Instead, she possesses a massive, flared, horse-like cock, complete with an accompanying pair of huge, heavy balls that hang down between her hindquarters. Matching the shade of the horse-like hair which covers her feral lower body, her animalistic genitalia are mostly dark black in colour, although there is a small amount of pale lilac mottling on her [natalya.cockSize], erect shaft.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the fact that you're quite clearly visible from where she's standing, Natalya hasn't noticed your approach, as her focus is entirely on the object which she just received from her cart. Following her gaze as she looks back and down at her rear hoofs, your eyes open wide as you see that the [natalya.race] has placed a gigantic, [style.size(56)] ribbed dildo down on the ground, which is facing directly up towards her ass. As she lowers her hindquarters down towards this massive toy, your eyes are drawn to Natalya's alluring asshole. Being puffed up into an ebony, doughnut-like ring, it looks just like a feral horse's at first glance, but as it drops down ever closer to the tip of the massive dildo, its true demonic nature is revealed, as you see that its surface is glistening with clear, slimy lubricant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still oblivious to your presence, Natalya drops her hips down a little further, letting out a deep moan as the tip of the dildo slips inside of her asshole. Panting and moaning, the [natalya.race] forces the first of the dildo's three bulbous ribs past the puffy rim of her asshole and into her slimy rear entrance. At this moment, the dildo reveals itself to be enchanted and starts vigorously vibrating, causing Natalya to let out another shuddering moan. Unable to cope with the pleasure, her legs suddenly give way, and you watch in disbelief as the remaining two ribs of the dildo obscenely stretch out the lithe [natalya.race]'s puffy asshole as they're suddenly forced all the way into her ass.
	</p>
	<p>
		At this moment, Natalya finally catches sight of you, and with copious amounts of precum drooling out of her massive horse-like cock, she staggers to her feet and shouts out, [natalya.speech(Y-You insolent [pc.girl]! How dare... ~Ooh!~ How dare you disobey my orders!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can respond, the arrogant sneer quickly returns to Natalya's face as she breathlessly pants, [natalya.speech(You need to be shown your place... I will train you to be an obedient filly! You will refer to me as your Mistress and kneel down before me... ~Mmm!~ Yes... Kneel down before your Mistress, filly!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As her throbbing cock continues to leak musky precum all over the floor, Natalya can't help but let out a deep moan, and you wonder whether you should do as she says and kneel before her, or simply turn around and take your leave...

		You really don't feel like submitting to this arrogant demon, and not wanting anything more to do with her, you turn around and quickly exit the alleyway. Shaking the image of Natalya's puffy asshole and throbbing cock out of your mind, you return to stand beside the cart,
		#IF(pc.hasCompanions())
			 where you spend your time enjoying the company of [com.namePos] as the two of you wait for the centaurs to be finished with their task.

			Turning her feral horse-like body around, Natalya flicks her tail to one side and presents you with her puffy, horse-like asshole. The massive ribbed dildo is still buried deep inside of it, and as you move forwards, you hear that it's still incessantly buzzing away as it vibrates inside of your Mistress's butt. As you reach forwards and take hold of the base, Natalya lets out a deep moan and commands, [natalya.speech(Pull it out slowly, filly! ~Ooh!~ You are also forbidden from touching my ass! ~Mmm!~ That will be a reward later on in your training!)]

		Waiting until you've opened the door for her, Helena steps back inside her store, before swiftly moving over to the counter and retrieving a small sign from out of one of the drawers. Turning to you, she commands, [helena.speech(Please replace the sign hanging in the door with this one. Then I would like it if you were to draw the blinds; I do not wish to feel as though I am on display.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking the sign from the harpy matriarch, which turns out to read 'Closed until grand reopening', you proceed to [pc.walk] over to the door and hang it up in place of the old one. Continuing to do as Helena asks, you then move over to close the blinds, which draws a murmur of disappointment from the crowd which had moved over to stare through the large glass windows. Turning back to face the beautiful harpy, you see her sitting down on the same sofa which she was perched upon when you first arrived. Letting out a slight sigh of relief, she turns to you and says, [helena.speech(What I would most desire at this moment is a relaxing cup of tea. As you have done such an excellent job thus far, I will gladly permit you to have one as well. You may find the necessary supplies and equipment in the back room.)]

Thankfully, everything you require is easy to find, and with only one type of teabag being available, you don't need to worry about choosing the wrong variety.

	<p>
		[helena.speech(Have you ever seen anything like it?)] the regal harpy smugly asks, clearly revelling in this opportunity to show off to you. Stepping over to the nearest shelf, she makes a sweeping gesture with her beautiful white wing and boasts, [helena.speech(All of these were given to me by a delightful succubus who owns some kind of potion manufacturing company, and all that was asked of me in exchange was to be publicly seen having lunch with her.

		Nervously gulping, Scarlett obediently takes the potion from Helena, before pulling out the stopper and drinking it all down. Immediately, the raven-harpy lets out a surprised gasp, and you and Helena watch as her lips plump up a little, before her face then quickly transforms to become more feminine and refined than it was just a moment ago. While definitely not being as stunningly gorgeous as the matriarch standing before her, you find yourself thinking that Scarlett's once-pretty face would now be more aptly described as being decidedly beautiful.

	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(I feel weird...)] Scarlett sighs, revealing that her voice has shifted to become noticeably higher-pitched. Lifting her black-feathered wings up to grope her chest, you can only watch in amazement as her tiny AA-cup breasts plump up and fill out into being B-cups. Moving downwards, the transformative effects concentrate in the harpy's ass and hips, which both visibly expand in size.

		[scarlett.speech(~Ooh!~)] Scarlett softly moans as she clenches her thighs together. Dropping her feathered hands down between her legs, she squirms about on the spot, and you realise that she's feeling her small penis transform away to be replaced with an avian pussy.

		[helena.speech(What did you just call me?!)] Helena angrily asks.

		Doing as you're told, you close your [pc.eyes], leaving you to guess what Helena's up to from the sound of her movements alone. From the soft tapping of her talons on the wooden floor, you can tell that she's slowly stepping closer, and as she approaches, her laboured breathing informs you that she's getting excited about what's about to happen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly, you feel the harpy's hot breath on your face as she leans in closer to you, and then, without any further warning, her plump, wet lips press against your cheek as she gives you an affectionate kiss. Before you can react, you feel her pull away, and you open your eyes to see that she's spun around on the spot and turned her back on you.

		Pretending to do as you're told, you close your [pc.eyes], before slightly opening one of them and peeking out to see what it is Helena's up to. As you watch, you see her cheeks flushing a bright scarlet, and after taking a deep breath, she starts slowly stepping towards you. Even without being able to see her, her loud, laboured breathing would be enough to inform anyone that she's getting excited about what's about to happen.

	<p>
		Coming to a halt in front of you, Helena nervously licks her lips, before leaning forwards so close that you can feel her hot breath on your face. Suddenly craning her neck forwards, she plants her plump, wet lips press against your cheek and gives you an affectionate kiss. Before you can react, she quickly pulls away, and you fully open your eyes to see her spin around on the spot and turn her back on you.

		[helena.speech(T-That was the second part of your reward!)] she quickly blurts out, and while still keeping her back to you, she continues, [helena.speech(A-As a further expression of my gratitude, I will allow you to... t-to take me out on a date each Friday night! I intend to work late on Fridays, so you shall meet me here between five and nine in the evening! Y-You are also permitted to come and see me in my nest at weekends and when I'm not working here. That is all!)]

		Clearly still too embarrassed to look at you, the blushing matriarch swiftly darts out of the room, before rushing past her harpy followers and exiting the store. Immediately skipping off down the street, she leaps into the air and flies off in the direction of her nest. Suddenly finding yourself with little else to do but leave, you walk across the shop floor towards the exit, ignoring the inquisitive glances thrown your way by the eight harpies who've remained behind to clean up. Pushing open the door, you [pc.step] out into Slaver Alley and wonder where to head next...
