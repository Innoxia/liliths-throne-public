	<p>
		Tucked away in one corner of Slaver Alley, you see a shop that's quite unlike all the others. Although the words 'Scarlett's Shop; open for business' are painted in fancy gold lettering above the door, the large glass windows don't show any sign of there being any slaves for sale. While the areas in front of all of the other shops in Slaver Alley are filled with advertisement boards and platforms upon which to display their goods, the area in front of 'Scarlett's Shop' is noticeably barren; yet further proof that this particular store must have fallen upon hard times.

	#IF pc.getQuest(QUEST_LINE_MAIN) == QUEST_MAIN_1_E_REPORT_TO_ALEXA
	#THEN
		<p>
			You haven't gone to report to Scarlett's matriarch, Alexa, yet, and you don't really want to have to talk to Scarlett until you've done as she's asked. Scarlett said that you can find Alexa up in the Harpy Nests, so you'll need to go there report to her before stepping foot inside this shop again.

	<p>
		Pushing open the door, you find that the shop's interior is just as bare as you feared. There isn't a single slave for sale in sight, and the only sign of life is a rather defeated-looking harpy slouched down at the shop's front desk.
	</p>
	<p>
		The harpy, who you assume to be Scarlett, looks up at you as you enter the shop, and with an annoyed huff, she shouts out, [scarlett.speech(If you aren't here to donate any slaves, then you'd better turn around and fuck right off! I'm not in the mood to deal with any fucking morons like you today.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Apparently this extremely rude harpy is the person that you need to deal with, and, letting out an annoyed sigh, you wonder if you should ask about Arthur now, or come back at another time.

		You're quite taken aback at Scarlett's rude words, and, deciding that it's probably best not to get involved with someone like that, you turn around and head for the exit.

	<htmlContent tag="SCARLETT_IS_A_BITCH"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Letting out a defeated sigh as you wonder why everything has to be so difficult, you walk towards the front desk where Scarlett is sitting.
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Didn't I tell you to fuck off already?)] the rude harpy calls out, sitting up in her chair as you approach.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Look, I just need to know if you've got a slave for sale going by the name of 'Arthur', ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you mention the name 'Arthur', Scarlett stands up from behind her desk, and her cheeks flush red as she starts to shout and curse, [scarlett.speech(If I hear that fucking name one more time, I swear I'm going to kill someone! Are you working with them?! Huh?! Those fucking cunts who fucked me over?! You've got five fucking seconds to start explaining!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite her foul language and aggressive posturing, you find Scarlett's little outburst to be more embarrassing rather than anything else. She clearly lacks the physical strength required in order to follow through on any of her threats, so it's more out of a desire to calm her down rather than due to feeling intimidated that you start to answer her, [pc.speech(Calm down, I'm not working with 'them', whoever they might be. I'm just a friend of Arthur's who's been trying to track him down. I found out from a helpful enforcer that he was meant to have been given to you. If you're still in possession of him, I'd like to see if I can buy his freedom, and if not, then could you [style.italics(please)] just tell me who you sold him to?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Huh,)] Scarlett huffs as she sits back down, [scarlett.speech(so I guess you really are as stupid as you look. Can't you see that I've got no slaves for sale? I'm fucking finished. And it's all thanks to that business with Arthur...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Rolling your eyes at the annoying harpy's reaction, you don't get any time to respond before she continues, [scarlett.speech(There might be a way for both of us to profit here though. Yeah, I know what happened to Arthur, [style.italics(and)] where he's gone, but I'm also not going to tell a fucking idiot like you anything about it. Not without helping me out first, at least.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Wondering just how many different people you're going to have to deal with before finally finding Arthur, you sigh, [pc.speech(And what is it I'd need to do?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Even a clueless moron like you can see that this business is a complete failure,)] Scarlett grumbles as she leans back in her chair, [scarlett.speech(and my matriarch is [style.italics(not)] going to be happy when she finds out. If you want to find out what happened to your stupid little friend, you're going to go up to the Harpy Nests, find a matriarch called 'Alexa', tell her that my business is bust, and take whatever punishment she'll decide upon on my behalf.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You realise that if you ever want to find out what happened to Arthur, you're going to have to agree to Scarlett's demands, even if you don't actually plan on taking any punishment on her behalf.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="SCARLETT_IS_A_SUPER_BITCH"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding to just agree with the insufferable harpy for now, you respond, [pc.speech(Fine, I'll do it, but you'd better keep your end of the bargain here. When I get back, you're going to tell me exactly what's happened to Arthur, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Just fuck off and do it already! Fuck, you're a real asshole to try and talk to, you know?!)] Scarlett shouts, looking just as infuriated as you feel right now. [scarlett.speech(Don't bother coming back here until you've taken Alexa's punishment, ok? And don't let her go easy on you, I'm gonna enjoy hearing what she did to you when you get back!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not wanting to waste any more time talking to her, you turn your back on Scarlett and walk out of the shop. As the door swings shut behind you, you find yourself wondering if you've ever met anyone as annoying as that harpy is. You seriously hope that this matriarch, 'Alexa', is nothing like Scarlett, and as you set off in the direction of the Harpy Nests, you wonder how many more hurdles you'll be presented with before finally finding Arthur...

		Once again, you find yourself standing before Scarlett's shop, but this time, you notice that the surrounding area is a lot quieter than usual. As you walk towards the front entrance, you pass a couple of wolf-girls as they hurry past the shop, and you can't help but overhear a snippet of their whispered conversation, [npcFemale.speech(...I'm telling you, it's <i>the</i> Alexa in there! Hurry up, before she sees us!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Stepping forwards, you see that the fancy gold lettering reading 'Scarlett's shop; open for business' has been roughly crossed out in red paint, and beneath, in the same scarlet hue, you read the new words 'Alexa's pet shop'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Curious to find out what's become of Scarlett, you wonder if you should enter the shop now, or come back later.

	<htmlContent tag="ALEXAS_SHOP_INTRODUCTION"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Pushing open the front door, you're greeted by the familiar, beautiful figure of Alexa sitting down behind the shop's counter. She throws you a delighted smile as you step inside the shop. [alexa.speech(Ah, it's you again! Please, do come in!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Doing as the harpy says, you walk up to the front desk, where you get right to business, [pc.speech(Hello, Alexa. Is Scarlett still around here somewhere? I really need to talk to her.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Alexa grins up at you, before turning her head to one side and calling out, [alexa.speech(Come, pet! This nice [pc.race] is asking after you!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speechNoEffects(M-Mrph...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You hear a quiet, muffled groan come from one side of the shop, and, turning to look in the direction Alexa is now facing, you see the submissive form of Scarlett kneeling beneath one of the many empty platforms that line the edge of the room. Your eyes open wide as you watch her obey her matriarch; obediently crawling out from her refuge, you see that she's wearing nothing except for a pink ball gag in her mouth and a heavy steel slave collar around her neck. With her groin fully on display, you're able to see that Scarlett's genitals consist solely of [scarlett.a_penisSize] cock, which sways back and forth as she crawls over to her mistress.
	</p>
	<p>
		[alexa.speech(Good pet!)] Alexa cries, leaning down to stroke Scarlett's plume of bright-red feathers. [alexa.speech(Now stay!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning back towards you, the matriarch smiles. [alexa.speech(As you might have seen from the sign outside, I've decided to re-brand my shop. And concerning Scarlett here, I've decided that she can pay me back for all her failures by being the first slave that I sell. So, if you were hoping to get some information from her, you'll have to buy her first.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You suppress a groan as you wonder just how many more hurdles you'll have to overcome before finally finding Arthur. No matter what your views on slavery might be, it looks as though you only have one option. You'll have to buy Scarlett, then demand that she tell you what happened to Arthur.

		After checking your license to make sure that everything's in order, Alexa counts out the coins, and, once satisfied that it's all there, she stands up from behind her desk. Walking over to Scarlett's hiding place, she reaches down and grabs her by the plume of feathers on top of her head. Dragging the unfortunate harpy over to you, Alexa throws her at your feet.

She sharply yanks her shoulder back, wriggling out of your grip as she sits back on her knees. You decide against providing more physical reassurance, and step back, smiling down at the angry little harpy with as much warmth as you can muster.

[alexa.speech(You just have to inform the Slavery Administration of your intent to set the slave free, and, seeing as all newly-bought slaves have to go through them first, their representative should be turning up here at any moment.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As Alexa says that, she points behind you, and you turn around to see Finch pushing open the shop's door, before stepping inside and holding up a little glowing crystal. [finch.speech(Someone called for a slave transfer?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You greet Finch, before informing him that you've taken ownership of Scarlett, and intend to set her free. He lets out a little laugh, before saying that now you've informed the Administration of your intent, all you need to do is take her collar off. With that, he turns around and leaves the shop, heading back to his post.

	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Y-You're really setting me free?)] Scarlett asks as you bend down and unclasp her collar, and as you reply in the affirmative, she mumbles, [scarlett.speech(T-Thank you...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[alexa.speech(If you're not a slave anymore,)] Alexa calls out to Scarlett from behind her desk, [alexa.speech(you'd best be reporting in to Lucy back at the nest. And don't think I've forgotten about your silly little outburst earlier; I'll make sure you're punished for that.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Yes, Alexa...)] Scarlett mumbles again, and before you can say anything, she dashes towards the door and runs out, heading back to Alexa's nest.
	</p>
	<p>
		[alexa.speech(You may have freed her from slavery,)] Alexa says, [alexa.speech(but that just makes her part of my flock again. Speaking of which, I've actually decided to let them get on by themselves for a while and have a bit of fun down here. The nests get so <i>tedious</i> sometimes. I'm going to get this shop up and running properly, so if you ever need to buy or sell any slaves, you know where to come first!)]
