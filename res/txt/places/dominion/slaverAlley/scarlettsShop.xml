		Despite the fact that this shop should be [style.colourGood(open)] for business at this time, you don't see any sign of activity inside. Furthermore, while the other shops in Slaver Alley use the area in front of their premises to proudly display advertisement boards and platforms upon which to display their goods, the area in front of 'Scarlett's Shop' is noticeably barren; yet further proof that this particular store must have fallen upon hard times.

		Pushing open the door and stepping inside, you quickly discover that the interior of 'Scarlett's Shop' is just as bare as it appeared to be from the outside. There isn't a single slave for sale in sight, and the only sign of life is a rather defeated-looking, black-feathered harpy slouched down behind a counter at the far end of the shop.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking up as she hears you enter the shop, the harpy lets out an annoyed huff, before shouting out, [scarlett.speech(If you aren't here to donate any slaves, then you'd better turn around and fuck right off! I'm not in the mood to deal with any fucking morons like you today.)]

		As she's quite clearly the shop's owner, this extremely rude harpy must be 'Scarlett', who's the exact person you're looking for.

		[scarlett.speech(Even a dumb cunt like you can see that this business is a complete failure, and my matriarch is [style.italics(not)] going to be happy when she finds out about it,)] the foul-mouthed harpy grumbles as she leans back in her chair, [scarlett.speech(If you want to know what happened to your stupid fucking friend, you're going to go up to the Harpy Nests, find a matriarch called '[helena.name]', tell her that my business is bust, and take whatever punishment she'll decide upon on my behalf.

You can't help but stare as you see that she's wearing nothing except for a pink ball gag in her mouth and a heavy steel slave collar around her neck. With her groin fully on display, you're able to see that Scarlett's genitals consist solely of [scarlett.a_penisSize], light-skinned cock and accompanying pair of vestigial balls.

	<p>
		[helena.speech(Good girl,)] [helena.name] says, standing up from behind the counter and stepping forwards to stroke Scarlett's plume of dark black head-feathers. With an underlying icy tone to her otherwise melodic voice, the matriarch calmly states, [helena.speech(As you can no doubt see, I've had to enslave my dear Scarlett so that she can use her body to pay me back for all the flames she's wasted while mismanaging this business I'd entrusted to her. I'm afraid that if you were hoping to speak with her about something, then you'll have to buy her from me first.)]

Upon seeing you waiting to take ownership of her, the gravity of her situation suddenly hits her, and with her cheeks flushing bright red, she turns back to her matriarch and screams, [scarlett.speech(You fucking bitch! You can't seriously be selling me to [pc.herHim]! You ugly whore, I'll make you pay for this!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The pleasant smile on [helena.namePos] face instantly vanishes as she hears Scarlett calling her ugly, and as the feathers on her head and wings bristle up, you can almost physically feel the icy rage she's about to unleash on your new slave. You'd better do something to silence Scarlett before this escalates any further.

		Thinking that it would best to show Scarlett some kindness, you reach up and place [pc.a_hand] on her shoulder, smiling reassuringly at her as she snaps back around to scowl angrily at you. Speaking in the softest tone you can manage, you say, [pc.speech(Calm down, Scarlett. It's going to be ok. Just take a deep breath and try to relax.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The raven-harpy's face flushes bright red, and for a moment you think that she's about to unleash yet another barrage of foul language, but instead she simply glares into your [pc.eyes] without saying a word. Sharply yanking her shoulder back, she wriggles out of your grip and steps away from you. Realising that any more physical contact is likely to send her into another fit of rage, you simply smile at the angry harpy with as much warmth as you can muster. Seeing that Helena is still on the edge of launching into a furious rage of her own, you ask your new slave, [pc.speech(Could you please apologise to Helena?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Although she's quick to anger, Scarlett isn't stupid, and quickly realises that as she's your slave, she'd better do as you say. Turning to face Helena, she mutters, [scarlett.speech(Sorry, Helena...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the smile doesn't return to her face, Helena's head-feathers flatten back down, and she icily states, [helena.speech(Don't you <i>ever</i> speak to me like that again.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that both harpies have calmed down, you ask Scarlett, [pc.speech(Now, do you think you can finally tell me where Arthur is?)]

		Wanting to put Scarlett in her place, you angrily berate her, [pc.speech(You insolent bitch! How <i>dare</i> you?! You're only to speak when spoken to, and if I hear <i>one more</i> insult come out of that filthy mouth of yours, you're going to be sorry!)]

		The raven-harpy's face flushes bright red, and for a moment you think that she's about to unleash yet another barrage of foul language, but instead she simply glares into your [pc.eyes] without saying a word. You hold her gaze, and after angrily staring at one another for a moment, Scarlett casts her eyes down to the floor.

		Wanting to put your insolent slave in her place, you step forwards, before quickly reaching up and delivering a sharp slap across her face. As she recoils back from your blow, you shout, [pc.speech(You insolent bitch! How <i>dare</i> you?! You're only to speak when spoken to, and if I hear <i>one more</i> insult come out of that filthy mouth of yours, you're going to be sorry!)]

		You see a flicker of defiance deep down in Scarlett's [scarlett.eyeColour] [scarlett.eyes], but she simply lets out a little huff, before rudely answering, [scarlett.speech(I don't have any fucking choice, do I? I'm guessing you know that Arthur was enslaved by the Enforcers. Well, through a random lottery, I was the 'lucky' person who ended up taking possession of him. Not five minutes after he was delivered here, some <i>bastard incubus</i> came by and demanded that I give Arthur over to him, without any payment!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You notice Scarlett fidgeting around as she starts getting angry at the thought of what happened to her, and she angrily curses, [scarlett.speech(That fucking cunt had all these official documents of minor infractions I'd committed while running this shop, and he made me fucking choose between being shut down or handing over Arthur! Obviously, I chose the latter option.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Do you know the name of this incubus? Or where he lives?)] you ask, desperate to finally find out where Arthur is being held.
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(I don't know, it was some stupid fucking name beginning with 'Z'... Hmm... 'Zaranix', I think it was,)] Scarlett growls, the very thought of his name making her cheeks flush red with rage, [scarlett.speech(The cunt's not hard to miss; after all, how many demons do you see choosing to stay in their male form? If you want to know where he lives, then you can find his address on a piece of paper in my drawer over there... I had to verify the fucker's slaver license, and made a note of where he lived so that I could go and get my revenge later...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Having overheard your conversation, [helena.name] pulls open the drawers beneath her counter until she finds the scrap of paper Scarlett's talking about. Helpfully walking over to where you're standing and handing it over to you, she then returns to sit in her chair once more. After taking a moment to decipher Scarlett's barely-legible handwriting, you groan as you realise that you're going to have to travel back over to Demon Home; the address where he's being kept is just a short way down the street from where his apartment building is.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your thoughts about how you're going to deal with Zaranix are suddenly interrupted by Scarlett's impatient shuffling, and you realise that you're going to have to decide what you're going to do with her before anything else...

		Deciding that you're going to keep Scarlett, you turn towards [helena.name] and ask, [pc.speech(Can I get Scarlett transferred somewhere? I don't have the time to escort her around right now.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(Well, of course. All newly-bought slaves have to be processed through the Slavery Administration first; now that you've concluded your business with Scarlett, she can be held there until you're ready to collect her,)] [helena.name] responds, before motioning with her wing to one side of the shop, [helena.speech(Please wait over there, Scarlett, I'll take you down to the Slavery Administration building once [pc.name] has departed.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You thank Helena for her cooperation and prepare to exit her store, but before you can leave, the harpy matriarch calls out, [helena.speech(I've decided to personally take over the management of this shop, so if you ever need to buy or sell any slaves, please keep me in mind!)]

		Not liking the idea of keeping Scarlett as a slave, you turn towards [helena.name] and ask, [pc.speech(Do I need to fill out some kind of form to set Scarlett free?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(Oh my, it looks like today's your lucky day,)] [helena.name] calmly says to Scarlett, before turning to you and replying, [helena.speech(All that needs to be done is to inform the Slavery Administration of your intention to set Scarlett free. As all newly-bought slaves have to be processed at the same building, I'll fill out the necessary forms for you at the same time.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(You're really setting me free?)] Scarlett asks, and as you reply in the affirmative, she mumbles, [scarlett.speech(Thank you... I guess...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(Wait for me over there,)] [helena.name] calls out to Scarlett, using her wing to motion towards one side of the shop, [helena.speech(Once [pc.name] has left, I'll have you set free, and then you can return to my nest. Oh, and don't think that I've forgotten about your silly little outburst earlier; I'll make sure that you're punished for insulting me.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[scarlett.speech(Yes, [helena.name]...)] Scarlett mumbles, walking over to one side of the shop and obediently waiting there.
	</p>
	<p>
		[helena.speech(I suppose I must thank you for returning a member of my flock to me,)] [helena.name] says, turning towards you with a smug smile on her face. Thanking Helena for her cooperation, you prepare to exit her store, but before you can leave, the harpy matriarch calls out, [helena.speech(I've decided to personally take over the management of this shop, so if you ever need to buy or sell any slaves, please keep me in mind!)]
