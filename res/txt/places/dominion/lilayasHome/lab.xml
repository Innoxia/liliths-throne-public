		[lilaya.speech(Oh, I can see how it's for the best alright,)] Lilaya replies, crossing her arms and letting her voice take on a sinister, icy tone, [lilaya.speech(For my entire life, I've been begging mommy to turn me into a full demon, but no matter what I said, she always refused, telling me that she'd sworn never to turn anyone into a demon ever again.

	<p>
		[pc.speech(Lilaya, please, there's no-)] you start to reason, finding your [lilaya.relation(pc)]'s cold, calculating voice to be of some concern, but you're not able to get even one sentence out before her composure breaks.

		[lilaya.speech(<b><i>No!</i></b>)] she screams, [lilaya.speech(I won't hear any of it! Both you and mommy have betrayed me, so you can make it up to me by convincing her to finally turn me into a real demon! I <i>hate</i> being a half-demon! <b><i>I hate it!</i></b>)]

	<p>
		Although most of her anger seems directed at your now-shared mother, Lilaya is definitely more than a little upset with you. As you're wondering whether to agree with her demands and convince Lyssieth to transform her into a full demon, she continues,

Noticing your entry out of the corner of her eye, she looks across and glares angrily at you, before starting to stand up. As she gets to her feet, you notice that her movements are slightly unusual, and as she steps around the table that she was working at, you see the cause of her clumsy motions taking the form of a clearly swollen belly.

That means all my kids end up as imps! Do you have any idea of how embarrassing and shameful it is to be called an 'imp-breeder', or 'imp-fucker'?! <i>Do you?!</i>)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you start to answer in the negative, Lilaya suddenly whacks you on the arm, and, with tears in her eyes, she shouts, [lilaya.speech(Get out! <b>Get out!</b>)]

		Reassuring your [lilaya.relation(pc)] that everything's ok, you walk her back over to her lab table, where she lets out one final sigh and says that she forgives you for not pulling out like she asked.

[lilaya.speech(You see, using absorbed essences is the way in which enchantments are infused into objects. Normally, demons have to buy bottled essences in order to absorb them into their aura, but <i>somehow</i> you'll be able to absorb them directly from a person, just like a Lilin can!

			Lilaya flicks a switch on one of the instruments, and the shimmering pink aura instantly vanishes from sight. Stepping forwards, she takes you by the [pc.arm] once more, and quickly leads you over to another corner of the lab, where a long, sturdy table is covered in all sorts of alchemical-looking apparatus. Large glass bottles filled with brightly coloured liquids bubble away without any apparent source of heat, and all manner of strange looking ingredients lie scattered over the table's surface. Coming to a halt in front of the workspace, Lilaya turns to face you. [lilaya.speech(Right, I can explain as we go...)]

	</p>
	<p>
		You blush as you feel her free hand press the wand against your inner-thigh, and, still holding her finger over your mouth, she starts to slide the arcane instrument up your body. You can't help but feel aroused as Lilaya presses the wand up and over your chest, while simultaneously trying to push her finger into your mouth.

	<p>
		You part your lips slightly, allowing Lilaya to slip her finger into your mouth. As she slowly starts sliding her digit back and forth past your lips, you notice a faint, salty taste hitting your tongue. As a second finger pushes its way in to join the first, you realise that this is the same hand she was using to finger Rose. Before you can object, you suddenly notice that she's using her free hand to give your groin an experimental squeeze, and, without thinking, you find yourself bucking back against her touch.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Good [pc.girl]...)] she whispers in your ear, [lilaya.speech(And just to think, I was worried that you wouldn't like this...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You've become so caught up in the moment that you haven't even considered putting an end to all this, but as Lilaya draws her fingers from your mouth, you have a sudden moment of clarity in which you find yourself once again thinking of how similar Lilaya looks and sounds to your aunt Lily.
		#IF(pc.hasFetish(FETISH_INCEST))
			 As you've got a serious kink for incestuous sex, you can't help but find this fact immensely arousing, and buck your groin even harder into your demonic [lilaya.relation(pc)]'s hand.
		#ELSE
			 Then again, she <i>is</i> a half-demon in this reality, so there's no real relation between the two of you... right?
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment, Lilaya leans in to whisper one last thing in your ear, [lilaya.speech(You know, I'm all-demon where it counts... You want to see what a demon's pussy looks like, don't you?)]

		You briefly wonder if it's your aura that's making Lilaya so horny, but whatever it is, you're feeling the same effects. You've never wanted someone as badly as you want her right now, and you feel your heart pounding as her soft, delicate fingers stroke over your lips. Before you can make the next move, Lilaya suddenly pulls back and takes the initiative. Stepping around to one side, she quickly throws one leg over yours and slides down to sit in your lap, bringing the two of you face-to-face.

		#ELSE
			[lilaya.speech(Mmm, yes!)] she giggles.
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can reply, your [lilaya.relation(pc)] throws you a quick, seductive smile, before taking your head in both hands and pressing her lips against yours once more. Reaching up, you pull her in close against your body, passionately making out with one another as you both give in to your lust.

		Before you can reply, Lilaya shuffles forwards, moving under your feral body as she prepares to start by using her mouth. Letting out a passionate [pc.moan], you prepare to have some fun with your horny [lilaya.relation(pc)].

	<p>
		Wanting to ask Lilaya about the possibility of inviting your new friend to come and live here, you take a step towards your demonic [lilaya.relation(pc)] and ask, [pc.speech(Er, Lilaya, you know all of these empty rooms you've got in your house?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Mmm, what about them?)] she answers, raising one eyebrow as she peers at you over the top of her glasses.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Well, I've got a friend, you see, and they're in a pretty rough situation. I was wondering if they'd be able to stay here for a while, until they've got back on their feet.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Lilaya lets out a sigh, and, placing her hands on her hips, asks, [lilaya.speech(Who's going to be the one paying for their food and cleaning bills? I trust your judgement, so I don't mind your friends using the spare rooms, but I'm certainly not going to be the one to foot the bill.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I'll pay for their rent and expenses,)] you reply. [pc.speech(I'll be able to afford that, don't worry.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Mmm, well, ok then. After all, the more people living here, the more opportunities I'll have to run some background tests on arcane aura fluctuations. You see, I'm very interested in finding out if your demon-strength aura has any sort of long-term impact on those around you. I doubt that it will, but as far as I'm aware, nobody's done research into this before!)] your [lilaya.relation(pc)] replies, giving you her explicit permission to invite your new friend to come and live here with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Thanks, Lilaya! You have no idea how much you're helping them out by doing this,)] you say, smiling fondly at your [lilaya.relation(pc)] as she pushes her glasses back up to the bridge of her nose.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Y-Yes, well, y-you're welcome,)] Lilaya stutters a little, blushing in response to your heartfelt thanks. [lilaya.speech(Just go to whichever room you'd like to use, then call for Rose to prepare it as a guest bedroom. A-And it's not like I'm doing this just for you or your friend, I-I'm just interested in researching the arcane!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ok, thanks again,)] you reply, not wanting to say too much more out of fear of embarrassing your [lilaya.relation(pc)]. Giving her a loving smile, you turn around and head for the lab's exit, determined to return to your friend and invite them to come and live here as soon as possible.
