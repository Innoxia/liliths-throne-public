		Taking your hands in hers, she leads you out of the lab and down the hallway.
		 You soon find yourself standing outside one of the many doors that line the corridor, and Lilaya steps forwards and holds it open for you.
		 Stepping inside, you find yourself in a specially-purposed birthing room.
		 Instead of being carpeted, like most of the other rooms in this house, clean white tiles have been chosen for this room's flooring.
		 A modern-looking birthing bed is sitting against one wall of the room, but apart from that, there isn't much else in the way of medical equipment.
		 A few comfortable chairs have been placed around the edges of the room, but other than those, and a drinks cabinet that's sitting in one corner, the room is devoid of any other furniture.
	</p>
	<p>
		As Lilaya leads you over to the bed, she explains the situation, 
		 [lilaya.speech(Ok, so I know you haven't done anything like this before, so I'll quickly explain what's going to happen.
		 In order for you to give birth, I need to focus a special kind of arcane spell into your nice little bump here.
		 Although you won't feel any pain, a lot of the arcane power I'll be using is going to be drawn directly from your aura, and there's a good chance that you're going to pass out from it.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You glance across worriedly at Lilaya as she says this, but she squeezes your hand in hers and reassures you, 
		 [lilaya.speech(Don't worry, you don't need to stay conscious during this.
		 Now, after I've delivered your children, they're going to grow pretty quickly, so don't be alarmed!
		 They're also going to be pretty hungry, but don't worry if you're not producing any milk, we've got everything they'll need in that cabinet there.
		 Oh, and also, they're probably going to want to leave straight away.
		 All children are born with a strong desire to go out and become independent as soon as possible, so don't take it personally if they've already left by the time you wake up.)]

			As she's speaking, Lilaya starts stripping off your clothes, and as she gets access to your vagina, she gently pushes you down onto the bed.
		#ELSE
			Your vagina is already exposed, so Lilaya starts by gently pushing you back onto the bed.
		#ENDIF
		 After following a few more of her instructions, you find yourself lying back with your legs held up and spread apart by a pair of sturdy metal supports.

		 In order for you to give birth, I need to focus a special kind of arcane spell into your nice little bump here.
		 Slimes, such as yourself, don't give birth like other creatures.
		 Those little cores inside of you don't need a vagina to exit through; instead, they'll simply split off from your body, taking some of your slime with them. 
		 Although you won't feel any pain, a lot of the arcane power I'll be using is going to be drawn directly from your aura, and there's a good chance that you're going to pass out from it.)]

		You glance across worriedly at Lilaya as she says this, but she squeezes your hand in hers and reassures you, 
		 [lilaya.speech(Don't worry, you don't need to stay conscious during this, and I'll make sure to keep feeding you fluids to replenish any slime that your children take with them.
		 I'll do the same with the newly birthed slimes, so they'll quickly get all of the fluid they need to mature to adulthood.
		 Oh, and also, they're probably going to want to leave straight away.
		 All children are born with a strong desire to go out and become independent as soon as possible, so don't take it personally if they've already left by the time you wake up.)]

		Lilaya gets you to lie down on the bed, and, smiling, she asks,
