		Positioned near the very centre of Dominion, Lilaya's home would be more aptly described as a palace, rather than a town-house. While the surrounding buildings are of an impressive size, you reckon that you could fit at least two or three of them into the plot which your [lilaya.relation(pc)]'s dwelling occupies.
	</p>
	<p>
		With your demonic [lilaya.relation(pc)] happily treating you as one of her blood-relatives, you've been given full permission to come and go from here as you please. If you wanted to enter the house right now, all you'd need to do is knock on the front door, and you can be sure that Lilaya's cat-girl maid, Rose, will respond in mere moments.

	</p>
	<p>
		As you forwards into the impressive entrance hall, the cat-girl maid retrieves a small box, wrapped in brown packaging paper, from off of the top of a nearby table. Smiling at you one last time, Rose hands the package to you, before excusing herself and quickly hurrying off

	<p>
		Opening the package, you discover that it contains a spell book and several scrolls, along with a small note which reads;
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'><i>
		Hi [pc.name],<br/>
		Here are the scrolls and spell book which I promised to send to you. Hope this letter finds you well, and look forwards to seeing you again soon!<br/>

	<p>
		Smiling to yourself as you finish reading the note, you put the contents of the package into your inventory, before discarding the now-empty box and packaging into a nearby waste-paper bin.

[arthur.speech(You know... there is <i>something</i> a little more interesting that I could do. You see, back when I was working for Zaranix, one of his ideas was to get me to find an arcane method of changing a person's sexual orientation. At first I thought it might prove impossible, like all his other ideas, but after doing a little research into it, I think I might actually have found a way to enchant a certain item that could do the trick. I'd never have use for such an instrument myself, you understand, but in the name of scientific curiosity, I'd very much like to test my theory.)]

	</p>
	<p>
		[arthur.speech(Ah! Thank you, [pc.name]! I hope you didn't have any trouble with Vicky; she can be a little overwhelming sometimes,)] Arthur says, taking the package from you and ringing the bell-pull in the corner of his room. [arthur.speech(As to what's inside, I'll show you right now!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Tearing off the tape that's holding the box together, Arthur quickly opens it up and reaches inside. Stepping closer to get a better look, you see him pull out a silver pocket-watch, with a long chain attached to the top. The hour and minute hands don't look as though they're moving, and the time that's shown is stuck at four minutes past ten.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(A broken pocket watch?)] You ask, a little unimpressed.

	<p>
		Before Arthur can answer, there's a knock at the door, before Rose steps inside the room. [rose.speech(You called, sir?)]

	<p>
		[arthur.speech(Ah, yes, Rose! Could you please ask Lilaya to come up here? I need her help with a special experiment,)] Arthur asks, and Rose obediently steps back and hurries off to fetch her mistress.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arthur hurriedly grabs several pages of notes, before placing them beside the watch on the table in front of you. Before he has any time to explain what his plan is, the door suddenly bursts open, and a very angry-looking Lilaya strides into the room. [lilaya.speech(What is it now Arthur?! Oh, [pc.name], you're here too!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[arthur.speech(Well, Lilaya, you know I told you about that research I did into changing a person's sexual orientation? Well, I-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Yes, I remember,)] Lilaya interrupts, [lilaya.speech(and do you remember <i>me</i> telling <i>you</i> about how I thought it was irresponsible to want to go around changing people's nature like that?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[arthur.speech(I don't intend to use it, Lilaya!)] Arthur objects, [arthur.speech(It's only for research purposes! If I could harness the arcane, I'd do it all myself... Please, all I need you to do is follow these instructions and enchant this watch.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Eugh, fine... But you're writing up a full report on this, on top of the work I've already assigned to you,)] Lilaya sighs, before stepping over to the desk and starting to follow Arthur's instructions.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few minutes, and several flashes of arcane energy, Lilaya's work is done, and you step forwards to see that the watch has undergone a drastic change. Now, instead of looking like a regular time-piece, the face of the watch is a swirling vortex of purple energy. Before you can take a closer look, Lilaya picks the watch up by the chain, and turns to Arthur. [lilaya.speech(So how does this thing work?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[arthur.speech(C-Careful, Lilaya!)] Arthur exclaims, averting his eyes from the watch. [arthur.speech(You just have to swing it back and forth in front of someone, and they should undergo a hypnotic-type effect, which, if my calculations are correct, will change their orientation. Oh, you should be able to channel arcane essences into it to change the desired orientation as well. We really need a test subject for this...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Well, whatever the result is, we can always undo it, right? I want to be the one who uses it, as I'll be able to sense if anything starts to go wrong, and you can't be the test subject, Arthur, as you'll need to be the one to fix any unexpected effects...)] Lilaya muses, before both she and Arthur turn towards you. [lilaya.speech([pc.Name]! You're ok letting us test this on you, aren't you? I promise that I won't apply the full effect, so there's really nothing to worry about!)]

The swirling purple face slowly shifts into a light purple, and, instructed by Arthur to keep focused on the watch, you fix your gaze on the mesmerising surface as Lilaya starts slowly swaying it back and forth.

The swirling vortex fades away, leaving the watch looking just like any other, and, satisfied with the result, Lilaya hands it to you. [lilaya.speech(I've removed the enchantment, so there's no fear of accidentally subjecting anyone else to those effects. I think you should keep hold of this. After all, now that you know what it feels like to be on the receiving end, I'm sure you have a greater respect for its power.)]

		You can't help but feel shocked as you hear that Rose willingly became a slave, but before you can ask why, she seems to sense your incoming question and continues, [rose.speech(When you sell yourself as a slave, all your debts and crimes are forgiven, so many people choose a life of slavery in order to escape their past. I suppose I'm somewhat of an unusual case, though, because I didn't have anything to run away from.

		Rose suddenly blushes, and you notice that her tail has wrapped itself tightly around her leg. She's obviously thinking back to when she first met Lilaya, and after taking a moment to move past her recollection of the past, she continues, [rose.speech(Lyssieth didn't approve of how much time we were spending together, and when Lilaya and I were discovered kissing one another, her mother didn't take it well... I was soon informed that I was to be fired, and instructed never to speak to Lilaya again. As you might understand, Lilaya and I were distraught. At my suggestion, we agreed that the only way Lyssieth would tolerate my continued presence would be if I were to become Lilaya's slave. True enough, her mother accepted my new place as her daughter's property, and from that point on we took extra care not to be discovered in one another's embrace...)]

She lives here in Dominion, in that huge tower that can be seen from miles around. Although she personally rules over this city, she allows her daughters, the elder lilin, to control other parts of her domain. Surrounding Dominion, there's plenty of farmland and woodland, which collectively is called the 'Foloi Fields', and is ruled by Lunette. Other than that, I know that there's a jungle to the north, ruled by Lyxias; a desert to the south, ruled by Lisophia; and the Endless Sea to the East, ruled by Lirecea.)]

		It seems as though every elder lilin's name beings with an 'L', and you wonder how Rose is able to remember them all. Even though the maid's information was quite limited, you're still grateful that she's told you a little more about how this world works. It doesn't look like she's finished just yet, however, and takes a little breath before continuing, [rose.speech(If you're looking for more information about the culture and ways of Dominion, then I suppose I can give you a few pointers as well. The most common races that you'll see walking the streets are demons, cat, dog, and horse-morphs. Although there are countless other races that inhabit this world, they mostly tend to stay in their home regions, so you'll see plenty of cow-morphs and rabbit-morphs out in the fields, but almost none in the jungle or desert.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Coming to the end, Rose finishes by saying, [rose.speech(The number of humans in our world seems to decrease every year. In order to escape the discrimination and prejudice against humans, they're more and more often choosing to transform themselves.

		As she says this, you suddenly become aware that she's holding a little feather duster, of the same 'French-maid' style as the rest of her uniform. Looking at the little instrument, you find your gaze being curiously drawn to Rose's delicate hands.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sensing what you're looking at, Rose suddenly blushes, and blurts out, [rose.speech(I use a duster like this so I don't have to get my hands dirty! You know, I take really good care of them, but Lilaya never seems to notice...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You don't quite know what's come over you, but you're finding it hard to think of anything other than Rose's perfect, feminine hands. As you watch, she places her duster down on a little table next to you, and, with a little step forwards, she starts to gently rub her hands together, sliding her slender, feminine fingers over each other and making little moaning noises. With a gulp, you suddenly realise that she's displaying them for your benefit, and as she looks up into your eyes, she makes a pleading little whine.

	<p>
		Wanting to help Lilaya to get her pregnancy over with as soon as possible, you produce a bottle of 'Mother's milk' from your inventory, before handing it over to Rose with the words, [pc.speech(Could you please give this to Lilaya? As you no doubt know, I got her pregnant, and I'd like to help her get it over with as soon as possible.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[rose.speech(Of course, [pc.sir],)] the maid dutifully replies, taking the bottle from you. [rose.speech(I know that mistress isn't opposed to drinking these, so I shall deliver it to her as soon as we're finished. I can assure you that she'll consume it straight away. If you had any more of these, it would be a good idea to wait for a couple of hours before handing them over to me, as I believe that the enchantment needs some time in which to work before any subsequent effects can be applied.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanking Rose for doing as you've asked, as well as for the information, you wonder what you should do next...

	<htmlContent tag="ROSE_TALK_OFFER_ROSE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Feeling that it would be fitting to offer this cat-girl maid her namesake as a gift, you hold out the red rose which you've been carrying with you towards her, and say, [pc.speech(This is for you, Rose, as thanks for all of your hard work.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she sees what it is you're giving to her, Rose's cheeks flush to almost the same deep scarlet as the delicate flower's petals, and as she takes the gift from you, she shyly smiles and shuffles her feet. [rose.speech([pc.Name]... That's so thoughtful of you! Thank you so much!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you watch her take the rose from you, you suddenly notice how delicate and perfectly-formed Rose's hands are. Even after all of the cleaning and manual labour she does as part of her duties around the house, she's somehow managed to keep her hands perfectly spotless, with nails that are manicured to a perfect finish.
	</p>

	<p>
		As Rose places the gifted rose into a nearby vase, you find yourself unable to look at anything but her hands... her amazing hands...
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.thought(Holy shit... Look at those hands!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With her cat-like tail swishing excitedly behind her, Rose sees what it is that's caught your attention, and holds up her perfect, angelic hands for you to admire. Her soft, pale skin almost seems to glow as she steps up in front of you, and you subconsciously start reaching out towards her delicate fingers. Her nails are painted a soft shade of pink, and as your fingertips touch with hers, you feel her soft warmth radiating into your [pc.armSkin].
	</p>
	<p>
		The moment you make physical contact, Rose lets out a desperate moan, and as her cheeks somehow manage to flush an ever deeper shade of crimson, she sighs, [rose.speech(~Aah!~ Yes! Lilaya never appreciates how much effort I put into keeping my hands so nice and soft! ~Yes!~ Take me! Take me now!)]

		The garden courtyard consists of a series of wide, perfectly trimmed grass pathways, each one lined with beds of brightly-coloured flowers. Although Rose is now the one responsible for maintaining it, you guess that Lilaya must have hired a professional company in order to have had this area landscaped so perfectly.

		In the very centre of the garden courtyard, a huge, ornate water fountain happily bubbles away with a mind of its own. The structure is made up of a collection of intricate statues; each one of a beautiful woman in some manner of indecent pose.

	<!-- ENTRANCE_HALL -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="ENTRANCE_HALL"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Lilaya's house is by far the most impressive building you've ever been in. The entrance hall that you find yourself standing in is alone far larger than your old flat, and is extravagantly decorated in a style befitting a royal palace. Fine paintings and marble busts line the walls, and a huge crystal chandelier hangs from the double-height ceiling, casting its warm light over a grand, red-carpeted staircase that leads to the upper floor.
	</p>
	<p>
		From previous explorations, you know that the rest of the house is furnished in much the same manner. You tried to count all the rooms once, but gave up after reaching well over one hundred. Despite its grand appearance and impressive size, the only member of staff you've ever seen is Lilaya's slave; the cat-girl maid called Rose. Lilaya herself spends almost every waking moment working in her lab, resulting in the house being eerily quiet for most of the time.

	<htmlContent tag="STAIRCASE_UP"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The grand, red-carpeted staircase is one of the first things you see when entering Lilaya's home. Half-way up the shallow steps, there's a secondary landing area, which is home to a couple of antique-looking cabinets and well looked after house plants. Branching off from the sides of this landing, two slightly-narrower staircases wrap around and lead up to the floor above.
	</p>
	<p>
		A huge portrait of two women hangs on the wall of the landing area, overlooking the entire entrance hall. You immediately recognise the half-demon sitting in the chair as Lilaya, and you can only assume that the gorgeous figure standing behind her is her Lilin mother, Lyssieth. Although Lilin can change their appearance at will, Lyssieth has chosen to appear as a beautiful half-demon in her mid-forties, and you wonder if she did this to make Lilaya feel more comfortable, or whether that's simply the form she prefers to take.
	</p>
	<p>
		Remarking one last time upon how beautiful the mother-daughter pair are, you continue on your way...

	<p>
		Standing at the top of the grand, red-carpeted staircase, you find yourself looking down at the huge portrait of Lilaya and her mother. Although you didn't notice it from the ground floor, you seem to detect a hint of annoyance in Lyssieth's eyes, giving you the impression that she's trying her best to hide her resentment towards either the artist, or someone who must have been close by.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wondering if you'll ever get to ask Lilaya, or perhaps even Lyssieth herself, about the circumstances under which this portrait was painted, you look away and continue on your way...
