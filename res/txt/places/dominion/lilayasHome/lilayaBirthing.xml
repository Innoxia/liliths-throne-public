		She suddenly breaks off from fondling your abdomen, before grabbing your wrist and starting to pull you further into her lab. Looking around, you see that Rose has vacated the area, leaving you alone with your demonic [lilaya.relation(pc)].
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(This is so exciting! I wonder how your body's going to react, what with you coming from another universe and everything!)] she exclaims, getting you to sit down on a nearby chair before running off to rummage around in some nearby boxes. As she does so, she shouts back over her shoulder, [lilaya.speech(I'm guessing you're not aware of how pregnancies work here, huh? Well, seeing as the arcane has a massive effect on it, I'm guessing it's pretty different than it is in your world! Hmm... Where did it go?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Lilaya stops talking for a moment as she concentrates on searching through the boxes. You aren't given much time to think about what she's saying before you see her straighten up and turn around, and as she starts walking back over towards you, you notice that she's holding another of those wand-like instruments in her right hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(So, I'm guessing you've already realised that the arcane has a big influence on pregnancy speed,)] she laughs, stroking your belly once more before stepping back and tinkering with some small dials on the instrument she's just retrieved. [lilaya.speech(I've actually done a fair bit of research on the arcane's influence on pregnancies, so I know that without its presence, pregnancies should really be taking about nine months...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As you try to assimilate the information Lilaya's giving you, the instrument in her hand starts giving off a faint pink glow. Letting out a satisfied hum, your demonic [lilaya.relation(pc)] brings the little wand down to your pregnant bump, before running it up and down over your swollen belly. Letting out a series of concerned humming sounds, a puzzled expression settles on Lilaya's face, but before you can start to worry about what might be wrong, the instrument suddenly releases a bright flash of pink light, causing Lilaya to let out a happy little cry.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(Well, that's a relief! Oh, right, I need to explain what's going on!)] she says, putting the instrument down on a nearby table before turning back to face you. [lilaya.speech(So, it turns out that your body has completely adapted to this world, and you're going to be obeying the same sort of rules for pregnancy as the rest of us! What that means is that you're not going to be pregnant for the better part of a year; it's going to be more like a few weeks at most. Oh, and also, the races of the children you're going to give birth to will be a split between your race, and the race of the father. Pretty exciting, huh?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(pc.isConfident())
			You look down at your pregnant belly, stroking it absent-mindedly as Lilaya's words sink in. As your thoughts turn to the process of bringing up a child in this strange world, you let out a deep sigh and ask, [pc.speech(How do people even bring children up in this world? And of course, what about the whole part of actually giving birth? I guess my life's going to change a lot...)]
		#ELSE
			You look down at your pregnant belly, stroking it absent-mindedly as Lilaya's words sink in. As your thoughts turn to the process of bringing up a child in this strange world, you feel yourself starting to become overwhelmed by emotion, and you blurt out to Lilaya, [pc.speech(B-but what do I do?! How am I meant to raise a child here?! A-And, what about the whole part of actually giving birth?! This is too much!)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Much to your surprise, Lilaya's face momentarily scrunches up into a look of confusion, as though she doesn't quite know what you're talking about. Thankfully, after just a moment, she lets out an understanding sigh, and quickly moves to put your fears to rest, [lilaya.speech(Of course, what with the arcane being the thing responsible for rapid growth as well, you'd not know how it works here... I'm sure this will come as a major relief, but you don't have to worry about raising your children; thanks to the arcane, they'll reach full maturity in just a couple of hours. The arcane grants them their mother's general knowledge, without transferring specific memories, so they get all the information they need to make their own way in the world. There's no need for any 'raising' or anything, don't worry. Honestly, I don't even know how people would be able to cope without the arcane!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As Lilaya finishes speaking, a huge wave of relief washes over you. You sink back into the chair, sighing deeply, before you remember your last concern about this whole process; the part about actually giving birth. Before you can ask Lilaya about it again, she continues, 
		#IF(pc.hasStatusEffect(SE_PREGNANT_3))
				 [lilaya.speech(Oh, and don't worry about the whole giving birth part. I see that your belly has already finished growing, so I can help you to give birth whenever you're ready!)]
			</p>
