		As you walk through the gloomy tunnels of Submission, keeping an eye out for any sign of danger, you suddenly spot what appears to be an unopened cardboard box, dropped to one side of a rubbish pile. Stepping over towards it, you don't see any sign of a trap or ambush, so, curious as to what could be inside, you tear off the sealing tape and open the lid.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just as you'd hoped, the package doesn't appear to have been opened before, and with no sign of its intended recipient in sight, you decide that there'd be no harm in taking the contents. Inside, you find...

	<p>
		A large stone building, spanning the entire width of the tunnel, has been erected here. A sign reading 'Official Enforcer Post' is clearly displayed beside the main entrance, and within, a dozen or so Enforcers are manning desks or standing guard beside internal doorways. None of them seem to pay you much attention, allowing you to come and go as you please.
	</p>
	<p>
		As usual, you see the short, busty form of the cat-girl Enforcer, Claire, hurrying around as she fetches and delivers all sorts of miscellaneous paperwork. If you wanted to, you could approach her and ask for some more information about Submission.

					Responding in the positive, you let the happy cat-girl take your [pc.hands] in hers, and you can't help but smile as she gets you to feel her pregnant bump. Concerned with the sort of work she's being asked to perform while pregnant, you ask, [pc.speech(Is there anything I can do to help? They're not making you work too hard here, are they?)]

	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Of course!)] Claire happily replies, [claire.speech(You know, not many people really ask about that sort of thing, but I so happen to be an expert on Submission history and customs!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You can't help but smile as the small cat-girl proudly pushes her huge breasts out and places her hands on her absurdly wide hips, before starting, [claire.speech(There are five main types of residents down here; rat-morphs, alligator-morphs, slimes, imps, and bat-morphs. That's not to say those are the only races down here, however. You can find all the same races as you would up in Dominion, but it's those five who make up the vast majority of the population. Out of all of those, it's only the imps who are invariably troublesome. You get good and bad in all the other groups of Submission society, but I've yet to hear of an imp who cares about something other than causing mischief or having sex.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You can tell from the shift in tone of her voice that even the mention of imps is getting Claire annoyed, and you can only imagine how much trouble they must cause for the Enforcers down here. Before you can say anything to steer the conversation in a different direction, however, she quickly moves on, [claire.speech(Anyway, the imps stick to the tunnels, which are also filled with muggers, aggressive slimes, and all sorts of other unsavoury folk. You should always stick to the main walkways, where the majority of rat and alligator-morphs make their home. The alligators prefer to use the water ways to travel throughout Submission, while the rat-morphs, just like all the other races, stick to the walkways.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(What about bat-morphs?)] you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Ah, yes, it's very rare for us to have to deal with any bat-morphs, as almost all of them stay down in the Bat Caverns. Thanks to their echolocation ability, they're not bothered by the dark, and have tunnelled out roosts up in the high ceilings of the caves down there,)] Claire replies, proudly smiling as she reels off all of this information. [claire.speech(About half of Submission's slime population lives down there as well. Apparently, they love the taste of the bioluminescent plants that thrive in some areas, and a lot of those slimes have eaten so much that their bodies have ended up glowing as well!)]

	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Well, as you might already know, Lyssieth is the Elder Lilin who's in charge of all of Submission. We Enforcers work to uphold the general laws of Lilith's domain, but it's Lyssieth who's in charge of giving us any special rules to enforce,)] Claire explains, uncomfortably shifting about a little as she finishes talking. Her small movements cause her huge breasts to start swaying from side to side in a pendulous manner, and you can't help but glance at them as she continues, [claire.speech(You should keep away from her palace. Her guards operate outside of our authority, and won't hesitate to attack if they suspect you of anything.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I'll be careful of them,)] you reply, before continuing, [pc.speech(but you mentioned Lyssieth setting special rules; what are those?)]

		Claire starts fidgeting even more as you ask that question, but despite her discomfort, she answers you, [claire.speech(Well, please don't go around telling anyone about this, but we've been told to ignore the anti-human laws that have been set in Dominion. You know, things like stopping and searching humans at random, and detaining them without reason for as long as we like.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I see,)] you respond, [pc.speech(So Lyssieth's only special rule is not to discriminate against humans?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Yes, but there aren't many humans living down here, so not many people know about this. Oh, and please don't go spreading this information. Everybody knows how much Lilith hates humans, and if she were to hear about this, I'm sure it'd be us, not Lyssieth, who gets punished,)] Claire mutters, before dropping back into her cheerful tone once again and asking, [claire.speech(Is there anything else I can help you with?)]

	</p>
	<p>
		Claire grins in delight as you mention the thing that she's most proud of, and immediately thrusts her disproportionately-large breasts out towards you as she proudly puffs up her chest and says, [claire.speech(I can tell you a little more, I suppose. I'm not really meant to talk too much about them, but it'd do some good to show a member of the public that we Enforcers aren't all bad! Basically, these teleportation pads allow me to instantly travel between the Enforcer posts down here in Submission in order to quickly relay messages. Being under-staffed down here, we don't have many demons who can use telepathy, so the higher-ups managed to get SWORD to give us some of their unused teleportation pads for long-range communications instead. You know, it's super rare for us Frontline Patrol units to get access to these kind of arcane devices; it's normally just SWORD or ORICL who get to use this kind of stuff.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(You must have worked hard in order to be chosen as the one to be using them then,)] you reply, hoping to encourage the proud cat-girl to reveal some more information about teleportation.
	</p>

		[claire.speech(Thank you, yes I did!)] she replies, letting out a happy, contented little sigh as she hears you recognising her hard work, [claire.speech(I really put everything I've got into this job, and it all paid off when I was the one chosen to have such an important assignment! Hey, you know what, how about I show you the pads some time? I can tell you're really interested in them, and it really would do some good to show the general public that we're not all trigger-happy maniacs like those SWORD guys.)]

That reward is still available.)]
	</p>

		[pc.speech(Well, when I encountered one of those slimes, they mentioned that they were transforming people due to following orders from a 'Slime Queen'.

	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Hmm... A Slime Queen...)] Claire mutters, before starting to pace back and forth. You can't help but notice the way her massive hips and huge breasts rhythmically sway from side to side as she struts back and forth, and look on in amusement as you notice that the other Enforcers are all giving her a wide berth. [claire.speech(You know, we'd heard rumours of a slime calling herself a Queen before, but we've scoured every last [unit.size] of the tunnels, and haven't found any trace of her.)]

		[claire.speech(Well, that's no good for us then,)] Claire sighs, stopping in front of you and placing her hands on her hips once more. [claire.speech(We're only authorised to patrol the tunnels and walkways. The only place where a Slime Queen could be hiding - if one even exists, that is - would be down in the Bat Caverns.

		[claire.speech(W-What? No! It's far too dangerous!)] Claire quickly replies, flustered by your response. [claire.speech(There are bat-morphs which can swoop down on you at any moment, aggressive slimes who'd just love to attack you, and the whole place is completely pitch-black!

		[claire.speech(W-Well, yes. I don't like to tell anyone, as I don't want to encourage people to seek out danger, but we do have a twenty-thousand flame reward for anyone who's able to put an end to this slime transformation problem.)] Claire says, wringing her hands with worry. [claire.speech(So if you're able to find and convince this Queen to stop, you'll have earned that reward. But please don't go looking for danger down there!

After all, if you were able to find and subdue this 'Slime Queen', you'd earn twenty-thousand flames. before you're able to decide what to do about this new information, Claire returns to deliver your reward, and after handing the flames over to you, she asks, [claire.speech(So, is there anything else I can help you with?)]

Is that the visitor here to see the pads?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Hey Karen! That's right, I got permission from Inspector Powell and everything,)] Claire replies, leading you over to yet another wooden door just past Karen's desk.
	</p>
	<p>
		[genericFemale.speech(Yeah, yeah, I know you've got permission,)] the wolf-girl replies, stifling a yawn before continuing, [genericFemale.speech(I'm getting off shift in two minutes, and Lucy's always five minutes late, so after you're done, could you cover for me until she shows up?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(Sure thing!)] Claire happily replies, opening the door and leading you through as she calls out, [claire.speech(See you tomorrow, Karen!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet another tired yawn follows the two of you through into the high-ceilinged room beyond, where you finally get your first look at these 'teleportation pads'. Devoid of any other furnishings, this room houses two of them, with each one taking the form of a bulky, circular metal pad, around [unit.lSize(300)] in diameter. Fixed to each one is a simple control panel, which sits atop a waist-high metal tube that connects to the pad below.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(So, here they are!)] Claire excitedly exclaims, [claire.speech(I wish I could demonstrate them to you, but teleportation is some seriously restricted stuff; even getting to see these pads is kind of a big deal. It's just fortunate for you that the Deputy Commissioner is as concerned with public relations as I am!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can give Claire your thoughts on the devices before you, she continues, [claire.speech(The one on the right is our backup pad, and is totally deactivated right now, so you can even stand on it if you want! Go on!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking the opportunity to get a closer look at the device, you do as Claire suggests and step forwards onto the smooth metal surface. Sure enough, the control panel looks to be completely dead, and for all intents and purposes, it's as though you're just standing on a big sheet of ordinary metal.
	</p>
	<p>
		[claire.speech(These things were designed to teleport up to four people at once, you know, which is why they're so big!)] Claire reveals, stepping up onto the pad beside you. [claire.speech(See? There's plenty of room! W-Wait, why is that lighting up?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Following Claire's suddenly-worried gaze, you look back across to the control panel just in time to see the half-dozen buttons and dials lighting up. The last thing you see before a blinding flash of purple light surrounds you are the words on the control panel's display screen:
	</p>

Suddenly being at a right-angle to the direction of gravity momentarily disorients you, and you only just manage to brace your short fall at the last moment.

Remaining motionless as the two of you wait to see if anyone follows you inside, the only sound in the dimly-lit stockroom is yours and Claire's excited, heavy breathing.

	<htmlContent tag="WALKWAYS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The main tunnels of Submission are surprisingly spacious, clean and full of life.
		 A deep channel of opaque, greenish water flows at a steady pace down the centre of each passage, and to either side, well-maintained wooden walkways have been built up against the grey stone walls.
		 Numerous bridges cross the watery divide at regular intervals, and every [unit.lSizes(10000)] or so, a series of stone steps trails down into the murky river to provide easy access for Submission's aquatic inhabitants.
	</p>
	<p>
		The damp atmosphere holds just enough chill to gently caress any exposed skin, but, thanks to the wide iron grates built into the ceiling, the air doesn't feel stagnant down here.
		 Looking up trough the iron bars, you're granted an unobstructed view of the sky, and, every now and then, up the occasional skirt.
		 The dizzying network of pipes and valves that run along the upper-half of the walls makes you feel sorry for whoever has to map and maintain them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Houses and shops of all kinds have been tunnelled out and built into the walls, and, while not as busy as Dominion, there are enough people ambling by to fill the tunnels with a continuous background drone of chatter and laughter.
		 There seems to be a heavy presence of Enforcers down here, and you can't go more than five minutes without seeing a patrol marching by.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite Submission being their home, you only see the occasional imp in this area;
		 evidence that they're so much of a nuisance that the vast majority of them are banished to the dark tunnels that branch off on either side of this main passage.
		 The vast majority of people that you pass are slimes, alligator-morphs, and rat-morphs, but there are also plenty of regular morphs eking out a living down here.

		Instantly, the dark grey hue of the staircase beneath your [pc.feet] is replaced by a soft, turquoise glow.
		 Looking down, you see that the stone steps are coated in a blanket of bioluminescent lichens and mosses, which, when pressure is applied to them, light up to illuminate their the area around them.
		 Although bright enough to allow you to see your immediate surroundings, the lichen's light drops off at a distance of about [unit.lSizes(1500)] or so, and you can't help but feel like it's painting you as a target to anyone lurking in the darkness beyond.

		Determined to continue on your downwards journey, you proceed to the bottom of the staircase, and find yourself stepping forwards into pitch-black cavern.

		As you step forwards onto the wide, well-maintained walkways, you quickly discover the reason behind the abnormal amount of people that are in this area.
		 All around you, brightly coloured canvas stalls have been erected, and as you pass, you see that they're selling all sorts of different goods.
		 This area is obviously Submission's main marketplace, and although the wares for sale aren't of any interest to you, they're enough to attract crowds of shoppers from all over Submission.

		 While the market stalls aren't worth your time, this building looks as though it contains something of interest.
		 Walking up to the open doorway, you see a little sign fixed onto the wall, which bears the words 'Open 24/7'.

		You find yourself walking down a stone pathway, which has been cut out of the rock floor of a colossal underground cavern.
		 The waterway that runs through Submission's tunnels continues on to one side of the path, flowing down the gently sloping floor to eventually fall away into a wide chasm that cuts across the far side of the cavern.
	</p>
	<p>
		This chasm serves as a protective moat for a massive, Gothic-styled palace that has been half-built, half-carved into the far stone wall.
		 A huge wooden drawbridge links the stone path that you're walking on to the palace's front gate.

		While you appear to be the only person making use of the path, you're not alone in this area. Up ahead, standing to attention beside the drawbridge, are the familiar figures of at least twenty of Lyssieth's royal guards. Although it's hard to see her clearly from this distance, you're still able to recognise Elizabeth at the head of them.

	<p>
		Having crossed the huge cavern, you find yourself approaching the massive Gothic palace that has been carved into the dark stone wall. In front of you, separating the huge front gates from the path that you're standing on, is a vast, seemingly bottomless ravine. A heavy wooden drawbridge crosses the pitch-black depths of the chasm, which appears to be the only means of entry to the palace.
	</p>
	<p>
		A group of twenty-or-so half-succubi are standing on this side of the ravine, and are preventing any unwelcome visitors from proceeding across the drawbridge. The majority of them appear to be half-demons, and, much like Lilaya, they have human faces and bodies, with demonic wings, horns, tails, and ears. Rather curiously, they're all wearing drab olive uniforms, with matching hats, skirts, and shoes. At each guards' side, they appear to have a holstered revolver, although, with the nature of this world being as it is, you know that they're likely to fire condensed arcane essences rather that actual bullets. These weapons, in combination with their uniforms, makes them look very much like mid-twentieth century British soldiers.

		The sheer obsidian walls of Lyssieth's palace drop away into the inky blankness of the ravine below you, and with the sole exception of the massive wooden gates before you, there's not a single weak point to be seen in the entire face of the carved structure. The few windows that break up the smooth, glass-like surface take the form of narrow arrow-slits, and all but the very smallest of these are covered with what look to be iron bars.
	</p>
	<p>
		A pair of masterfully-carved stone gargoyles, each one standing at well over [units.size(250)] in height, snarl down at anyone crossing the drawbridge. Every time you glance up at one of them, they seem to be wearing a slightly different expression, but whether this is some arcane-enchantment, or just your imagination, you can't tell. As you've come to expect from this world, the two sculptures are completely naked, and while each of the masculine figures are sporting balls large enough to put a horse to shame, it's what their cocks are buried in that catches your attention the most. Appearing to be carved out of the same jet-black obsidian, a rat-girl and succubus are being restrained in full-nelson holds; their legs lifted from the floor as the gargoyles' cocks slam deep into their exposed pussies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Casting your gaze back down from the lewd expressions on each of the girls' faces, you turn your attention to the huge wooden gates before you. Set into the wall of the palace by about two or three feet, the only observable entrance boasts an extra line of defence, in the form of a thick metal portcullis. Thankfully, this has been raised, allowing Elizabeth to freely approach the doors before you.

	</p>
	<p>
		In the very centre of the cavern's huge floor, a considerable amount of earth and rock has been dug out and piled up to form a large mound. On the top of this hill, a crude fence, made out of all sorts of old planks and bits of rubbish, has been erected. Within this circular enclosure, a squat wooden keep has been constructed - looking every bit as crude as its protective fence.

		Glancing over at the rudimentary gate that's set in to one side of the wall, you see two alpha-imps standing guard. They seem more interested in talking to one another rather than keeping a close watch, and so haven't spotted you yet. If you were feeling brave enough to try and gain entry to this imp stronghold, you could approach them and see if you can either talk or fight your way through

		Glancing over at the rudimentary gate that's set in to one side of the wall, you see two alpha-imps standing guard. They seem more interested in talking to one another rather than keeping a close watch, and so haven't spotted you yet. As you're on friendly terms with the leader of this imp fortress, you're able to pass the guards and enter the fortress without any risk of a fight.

		Glancing over at the rudimentary gate that's set in to one side of the wall, you see that it's been left wide open, and there's no sign of life within the courtyard beyond. The imps that once ruled over the surrounding tunnels are obviously still too frightened to return, but you can be sure that's it's just a matter of time before they gather their courage and lay claim to this fortress once again...

		For some time, you've been feeling that the tunnels in this part of Submission have been sloping down towards something, and as the passage suddenly opens up in front of you, you discover that this 'something' is a huge, dark cavern. Unlike the rest of Submission, there are no iron grates set into the ceiling, so, due to the absence of light from sun or moon, numerous arcane-powered lanterns have been hung from long chains fixed to the high ceiling, which cast a dim golden glow over the huge subterranean space before you.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most remarkable feature of this area, and the one that instantly catches your eye, is that a huge stone citadel, reaching from floor to ceiling, has been built up against the far wall. Although there are slender arrow-slits set into the walls of the adjoining towers, they all appear to be firmly shuttered and bolted from within.
	</p>
	<p>
		A worn path leads up to the entrance, and, walking down it, you discover that the citadel's gates are carved from dark black stone. Three small keyholes have been drilled into the very middle of them, and, looking up, you see that there's an inscription on the stonework above, which reads:
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center'><i>
		In this mighty citadel, resides the Dark Siren; Daughter of Lyssieth, Empress of the arcane, Bearer of cataclysmic terror, She who rends worlds; Those who seek her favour must first prove themselves, and with three keys, then enter.
	</i></p>

		Once again, you find yourself stepping forwards into the huge underground cavern that houses the ruins of [siren.namePos] citadel. Despite the fact that the one-time residence of the 'Dark Siren' is now destroyed and abandoned, the numerous arcane-powered lanterns hanging from the cave's high ceiling are still active, and they cast a dim golden glow over the huge subterranean space before you.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Walking over to where the citadel's ruins now lie, you take note of the fact that over half of the outer wall has crumbled into an impassable pile of loose rocks and shattered masonry. Thankfully, the citadel's main gates seem to have avoided taking significant damage, and have been left wide open. The surrounding structure hasn't been so lucky, however, and a significant amount of the inscribed stonework above the gates has been smashed to pieces, so that it now reads:
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center'><i>
		In ... citadel, ... Dark Siren; Daughter ... Lyssieth, Empress ... cataclysmic terror, She who ... favour ... first ... three keys, ... enter.
	</i></p>
	<p>
		The ruins look dangerously unstable, which is obviously the reason why no imps have chosen to return to this place. If you were careful, however, you think that you could pass through the gates and explore the ruins without risking injury.

		From a brief inspection of the citadel's walls, you can see no other way to gain entry. However, as you have the 'three keys' that the inscription refers to, it looks like opening the gates won't be a problem...

	<htmlContent tag="IMP_CITADEL_KEY_ENTRY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You decide that the time has come to use the three keys required to open the gates to the dark siren's citadel. As you insert the first of them into its corresponding hole, it suddenly disappears from sight in a bright purple flash. Around the keyhole, a glowing pentagram appears, and, encouraged that this is the right thing to do, you quickly insert the other two keys into their respective locks, each of which produces much the same effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the third key vanishes, a vertical purple line splits the stone gates down the very middle, and, with a loud grinding noise, they slowly start to swing open before you. At that moment, yet another bright purple flash is emitted by each of the three keyholes, causing you to blink and turn your head to one side. As you rub your [pc.eyes] to clear the lingering afterimage, you see that the three keys have reappeared in the keyholes before you, and have been linked by a thin silver chain. Grabbing this key-chain necklace from out of the gates, you wait as they fully swing open before you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stepping forwards into the citadel, you find yourself looking out across the inner courtyard, and you see that the material used in the construction of the outer walls and gateway has been obtained by mining out a large portion of the far wall. Carved into this recess, there's a huge stone archway, which houses a pair of massive, iron-reinforced wooden doors. Off to your left, you see a well in one corner of the courtyard, and beside that, there sits a squat, stone tower. On the opposite side of the courtyard to this tower, the cave's wall curves inwards, and into this, a small doorway has been carved.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most alarming thing about the scene before you is that there are at least twenty imps and alpha-imps scattered around the courtyard. A few of them are simply loitering about, but most are engaged in simple tasks such as cleaning and mending clothes, sparring with one another, or preparing and eating food. You also notice that there are a few who are openly having sex over in one corner.
	</p>
	<p>
		None of these imps seem bothered about your sudden arrival, and you assume that it's because only expected guests would be in possession of the three keys required to gain entry. As you move forwards into the courtyard, the nearest of the imp guards calls out, [genericMale.speech(The siren's in 'er throne room, if yer were lookin' fer 'er!)]

		You're surprised to see that none of the imps have returned, and that the courtyard before you is completely deserted. Although there's no sign of anyone being inside the laboratory tower or cell block, you can see slivers of light shining out from the cracks around the keep's huge wooden doors, letting you know that the siren is still at home...

	<p>
		Although the dark siren's citadel now lies in ruin, you find yourself wanting to head back inside and explore. You don't need to use your key-chain necklace to gain entry, as the stone gates have been permanently jammed open. Taking care as you step around the piles of smashed rock piled up against the gates, you walk forwards through the entranceway.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking over the cracked, rubble-strewn courtyard, you find yourself gazing at the huge, ruined archway of the main keep. One of the huge wooden doors has completely splintered into pieces, while the other looks to be straining under the weight of the crumbling masonry above. Off to your left, the citadel's well looks to have been completely crushed beneath the collapsed left-side wall of the laboratory tower. On the opposite side of the courtyard, you see rubble and smashed rock blocking the small doorway of the cell block.
	</p>
	<p>
		All in all, the citadel looks to be in a dangerously unstable condition, which would explain why there's absolutely no sign of life anywhere before you. Exploring these ruins will be slow going, as you need to carefully navigate around gaping fissures and piles of precariously stacked rocks.
