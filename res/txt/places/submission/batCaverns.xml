	<p>
		This area of the bat caverns is home to the staircase that leads back up to Submission. A wooden sign next to the staircase warns any traveller against consuming the mushrooms found in certain parts of the caverns. A picture of some glowing blue mushrooms is displayed next to this warning, and beneath that, there's some information that identifies this particular fungi to be an exception. Apparently, it's the only edible type of mushroom that grows down here, and is highly sought-after by the slimes which inhabit these caverns. Apparently, eating these mushrooms has caused the slimes down here to glow, and also causes them to experience psychedelic effects, which makes their behaviour highly unpredictable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking up towards the top of the staircase, you see the relatively bright lighting of Submission's tunnels shining down to illuminate the top dozen or so steps.
		 Perhaps because of that ever-present source of light, this area seems entirely deserted...

	<p>
		The oppressive, inky blackness of the bat caverns is kept at bay by the softly glowing moss beneath your feet. With every step, a new pool of the low light blooms outward as the previous one fades, allowing you to see out to roughly [unit.lSizes(1500)] all around you. Above your head, the cavern's roof is so high that all you can see is a blanket of completely impenetrable darkness. Occasionally you think you hear a sound, a high-pitched keening, from somewhere up there, but you try not to think too hard about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's an ever-present dripping sound that echoes from everywhere and nowhere, giving the caverns its own ambient, if unfocused, melody. The air is also surprisingly fresh, clean and cool; not at all what you'd expect from a typical cave. Indeed, the fresh air down here is certainly chilly enough to raise goosebumps on any exposed skin and harden nipples beneath clothing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You weave through clusters of stalagmites as you proceed forwards through the darkness, reaching out to use the smooth, cool stone for support as you step over little streams and narrow cracks in the floor.

		Compared to the majority of the bat caverns, the area you find yourself standing in is lit up like a beacon. The moss carpet beneath your feet thrives in amongst bioluminescent fungi of all shapes, sizes, and colours, and forms trailing paths which wind through the area. While some of these mushroom-like plants approach the height of trees, the vast majority are no more than twenty-or-so [unit.sizes] tall. Pools of still, shallow water are to be found scattered throughout the floor of this underground forest, and by reflecting the many hues of light from the surrounding flora, they give this place an unearthly, almost ethereal ambiance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The luminescence given off by the fungi is bright enough to reveal just how colossal these caves are. The tips of stalactites, illuminated by the taller of the tree-sized mushrooms, look to be almost [unit.lSizes(10000)] above your head, while the base where they connect to the ceiling, still shrouded in darkness, is significantly higher even than that. Some of the largest of these spires have points of light shining out from them, and you realise that you're looking upon the carved-out windows of bat-morphs' roosts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like the dark parts of the caverns, there's an ever-present dripping sound that echoes from everywhere and nowhere, producing an ambient, if unfocused, melody. The air is also surprisingly fresh, clean and cool; not at all what you'd expect from a typical cave. Indeed, the fresh air down here is certainly chilly enough to raise goosebumps on any exposed skin and harden nipples beneath clothing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the fact that this area is well illuminated, there are enough of the tree-sized mushrooms present to provide any would-be attacker with a convenient hiding place...

	<p>
		A slow-moving underground river carves its way through the bat caverns, and it's beside this body of water that you find yourself travelling. While the river's surface is illuminated by the bioluminescent lichen, the light is too dim to penetrate the cool, dark depths, and you wonder what sort of creatures, if any, would call such an inhospitable place home.
	</p>
	<p>
		The air in this part of the caverns is particularly fresh and cool, and you feel a slight breeze blowing over the exposed parts of your body. Perhaps due to the immediate proximity of such a large body of water, the dripping sounds that are found all throughout the caverns are particularly loud here, and you often find yourself turning around to check that nobody's using the noise to mask their approach...

While the river's surface is illuminated by the bioluminescent lichen, the light is too dim to penetrate the cool, dark depths, and you wonder what sort of creatures, if any, would call such an inhospitable place home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you, small patches of glowing turquoise fungi grow along both sides of the river's sheer banks. A pair of tree-sized bioluminescent mushrooms grow out from the middle of these patches, and have been shaped into a horizontal, weaving pattern by the residents of these caverns in order to form a living bridge across the water's dark depths.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stepping up to this fascinating structure, you see that planks of wood have been tied to the mushrooms' stalks in order to provide sturdy footing. Rope-netting has also been cunningly erected to either side, making this bridge a very safe way to get to the path on the other side.

	</p>
	<p>
		The cavern's roof slopes down before you, and the path that you were walking on suddenly comes to an abrupt halt as it meets a solid wall of stone. The river to your side drops away into a pitch-black abyss, and by the light of the lichen underfoot, you see that a finely meshed metal grate has been built to save anyone from being swept down into the bottomless depths below.

		With no way forwards, you'll have to turn around and double-back on yourself...

	<p>
		The underground river before you widens out into a huge, still body of water. You can't help but stop in your tracks as you find yourself looking upon a gigantic underground lake, its still, black waters illuminated by the countless mushrooms of the bioluminescent fungi forests that line its banks.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Out in the middle of the lake, you see a small island, covered in glowing lichens, mosses, and mushrooms. On the island's highest point, you can see that someone's built a stout stone tower, complete with medieval-style crenellations. Although it's quite some distance away, you can see light shining out from the arrow slits in the tower's walls, and at the base, a large wooden door appears to be firmly closed and barred.

		From this distance, it looks like there's no possible way to gain entry to such a well-fortified structure. You have no reason to visit the tower at the moment, but if ever you had business with a reclusive individual who might lock themselves away somewhere in the Bat Caverns, you now know where to look.

		You have a strong feeling that this is the place where the elusive 'Slime Queen' is hiding. Looking around for a way to cross the wide expanse of water, you soon find a small jetty, which has been built behind several particularly large mushroom-trees in order to try and keep it hidden from passersby. There are several little wooden boats tied up beside it, each one complete with a pair of oars. You suppose that this is how the Queen's visitors travel back and forth from her tower, and wonder if you should use one of these boats to pay her a visit.

	<htmlContent tag="SLIME_LAKE_BOAT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You step down into the nearest wooden boat, before quickly sitting down and grabbing hold of the sides in order to stop it from rocking. Sliding the oars through the oarlocks, you push off from the jetty and start rowing towards the island.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your journey across the lake is uneventful, and before you know it, you've reached your destination. Built into the lake's shore, you see a jetty which is very similar to the one from which you departed. Mooring your boat alongside this jetty, you start to walk up the island's gentle incline towards the stout stone tower.

	<htmlContent tag="SLIME_LAKE_FLY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Seeing no need to use one of boats, you take a small run up towards the lake's shore, and, with a flap of your wings, launch yourself into the air. Circling around a couple of times to gain altitude, you glide over the lake's calm, still surface, speedily making your way towards the island.
	</p>
	<p>
		It only takes a minute or so to reach your destination, and, with a final flap of your wings, you land on the island's shore, right beside a wooden jetty that's the mirror image of the one on the lake's far side. Smiling to yourself as you think about those poor people who aren't able to fly, you begin to walk up the island's gentle incline towards the stout stone tower.

Although there's no sign of life outside the tower, you know that [slimeIce.name] and [slimeFire.name] are standing guard just inside the entrance. As you've already come to an arrangement with the Slime Queen, you're free to come and go from her tower without having to worry about fighting her guards.

		Although there's no shortage of bioluminescent fungi in this area, you can tell that the vast majority of it is poisonous, and is clearly unsuitable for consumption. As you walk past a particularly large mushroom-tree, however, you see a little cluster of glowing blue mushrooms that look to be quite different from all the rest. Crouching down, you take a look at this peculiar fungi, and, comparing it to the mushrooms on the sign at the entrance to the Bat Caverns, you're certain that these are the ones that are edible.

Beside this pool of orange goo, you see that one of the participants of what you assume to have been a sexual encounter has dropped a little package.

As you approach, you can see that this shadow is actually a well hidden door handle jutting out from the rock.
	</p>
	<p>
		Between the dim light and the thick layer of dust on it, you can't tell how old it is or how long it's been there. Briefly glancing around, you can see no obvious seams or hinges that might suggest the presence of a door. This might be a trap.

		Taking your chances, you grab the handle. To your surprise, the moment you make contact with the cold metal glowing letters appear in the cavern wall spelling out the question "Fiat Justitia?" You give the handle an experimental tug, but it remains fixed in place. Looks like the wall wants an answer, and since you're not sure how to answer there's nothing more that you can do at the moment. The glowing letters fade away when you let go of the handle.

		As you carefuly navigate the myriad obstacles offered by the cavern, you almost slip on something beneath your feet. Grumbling to yourself about the responsible disposal of slippery objects in a damp cave, you find the cause of your near-faceplant to be a piece of laminated paper. Strangely, it appears be a page from a journal of some sort that someone laminated after it had already been torn out. Even more strangely, someone tore it in half after going through all the trouble of laminating it. Water has gotten inside the seal and rendered most of the page unreadable but you can still make out an entry.

			Under Astrea's command, we have successfully broken through into the Bat Caverns. At last, a way into the wretched heart of Dominion! And not a moment too soon, if news from the other fronts is to be believed. A small hideout hidden in the cave wall will provide us a staging area for the operations to come, and in any case, the cool damp is a welcome relief from the sweltering heat above. The door has been enchanted to only open for those who know the password:</br><center>RUAT C</center>
