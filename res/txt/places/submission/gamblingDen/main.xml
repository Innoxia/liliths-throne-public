	<p>
		The wooden doors of the Gambling Den's front entrance are propped open, allowing you to easily make your way forwards into the establishment. As you enter, you find yourself standing in a very large entrance hall. A sign hanging from the ceiling in front of you reads 'Welcome to the Gambling Den!', and from somewhere further within the building, you hear the distinctive sounds of laughter, conversation, and then of a slot machine dispensing coins to a lucky winner. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Although there only a few people loitering around in this entrance hall, the constant drone of chatter coming from up ahead lets you know that this place must be quite popular. As you start to walk forwards, intent on exploring the establishment, a voice suddenly calls out from your right-hand side, [axel.speech(Hello there! I haven't seen you here before!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning towards the source of the voice, you see a tall, muscular alligator-boy grinning at you. The scales covering his body are all a brilliant white, and as he comes to a halt in front of you, his pair of bright blue eyes lock onto yours, and he continues, [axel.speech(I'm [axel.name], the owner of this place, and I like to say hello to every fresh face I see!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I'm [pc.name],)] you reply, returning the alligator-boy's greeting as he happily reaches out to shake your hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(It's a pleasure to meet you! Now, if you're looking to have some fun, you've come to the right place. We've got dice poker straight ahead down the hall here,)] [axel.name] says, pointing one of his clawed hands forwards, before turning it to the right and continuing, [axel.speech(and the slot machines are lining the main atrium down to the right there. If you continue on down to the very end, you'll find my good friend Epona, who runs our very special 'pregnancy roulette' game! You can get all the details of that from her.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Thanks,)] you say, [pc.speech(I'll go and check it all out.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Oh, and, erm, we've also got a shop,)] [axel.name] says, the friendly tone of his voice shifting into one of discomfort. [axel.speech(Roxy's the one that runs it. Just be careful around her, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ok, I'll see you around,)] you say, letting [axel.name] hurry off to one side of the hall before moving off to explore the building.

	<p>
		As you enter the gambling den, you once again spot the large, muscular figure of [axel.name] happily welcoming visitors to his establishment. Upon catching sight of you, his smile widens, and he hurries over to thank you for what you've done, [axel.speech([pc.Name]! I can't thank you enough for helping me sort out that whole Vengar situation! If I'm honest, I didn't really expect you to be able to do it, but I'm finally free of him! Well... Almost free, that is...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Asking Axel what he means by that, and also how he found out that Vengar had been dealt with so quickly, you listen as the albino alligator-boy explains, [axel.speech(Well, I had a visit from the Enforcers, you see. Apparently, they confiscated all of of Vengar's wealth as 'evidence', so they couldn't give me any of my money back. Instead, they gave me a different form of compensation...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment, you notice the familiar figure of Roxy swiftly walking over from her shop, and, not caring at all about interrupting your conversation, she shouts out, [roxy.speech('Ey! Lizard! I's got another question 'bout Vengar!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Please, I already asked you not to call me that,)] Axel replies, turning to one side to face the rat-girl, [axel.speech(and can't you see that I'm talking to [pc.name]? You could at least say 'excuse me', you know...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[roxy.speech(I ain't got time fer yer shit,)] Roxy states, before pausing for a moment to stick a cigarette in her mouth and light it. Blowing out a large cloud of smoke, she continues, [roxy.speech(So, you's said I could do anythin' I wanted with Vengar, right? It ain't gonna be a problem fer me later down the line if I get 'im addicted ta me cunt or transform 'im a bit, will it?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Look, I don't want you abusing people you're responsible for, even if he is your ex and he wronged you in the pas-)] Axel starts, but Roxy furrows her eyebrows and interrupts him yet again.
	</p>
	<p>
		[roxy.speech(Don't you's be gettin' involved in me private life, lizard! That fuckin' twat wants ta cheat on me, an' thinks he's off the hook cos he set me up workin' here? He can fuckin' think again!)] she shouts, before puffing on her cigarette and repeating her initial question, [roxy.speech(So can I get 'im addicted to me cunt an' transform 'im a bit or not? I don't want ya gettin' all pissy later on just cos I didn't ask or some shit like that.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the nearby patrons of the gambling den start to turn their heads at the scene unfolding before them, and, wanting to avoid this negative publicity, Axel gives in to Roxy's demands, [axel.speech(Yes, yes, I already said you can treat him like he's yours, so long as you prevent him from causing any damage to my business. Just... don't go too far, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Letting a wicked grin settle on her face, Roxy turns her back on the two of you and marches back off to her shop, calling over her shoulder and addressing you as she goes, [roxy.speech(Ya want a taste o' my cunt, all yer gotta do is drop by later! See ya!)]

	<htmlContent tag="AXEL_VENGAR_RESOLUTION"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		With an exasperated sigh, Axel turns back towards you and reveals what by now was obvious, [axel.speech(Yes, that 'compensation' the Enforcers gave me was a Slaver License and the recently-enslaved Vengar, as well as another of his thugs; some nasty piece of work called 'Murk'. I have neither the time nor inclination for dealing with those two, so I agreed to give Vengar to Roxy, while Murk is being watched over by Epona.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You ask Axel if he's considered selling the two of them, seeing as he doesn't have any real interest in owning slaves. Letting his shoulders slump, and releasing another heavy sigh, the alligator-boy reveals, [axel.speech(The Enforcers have places selling restrictions on the two of them. They said they might need evidence from them later, and don't want to be chasing paper trails all over the city, so I'm stuck with them. Anyway, enough of my troubles, I need to get you a reward!)]

		 After just a couple of minutes, he returns holding a small bag, and with a big smile on his face, pushes it into your [pc.hands]. [axel.speech(This is for all your trouble, and you also have my eternal thanks!)] he happily exclaims, before revealing, [axel.speech(There are fifty thousand flames in there.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Opening the bag, you see that it's filled with coins, and after thanking him, you wonder what to say to Axel next...

		Picking up on the name which [axel.name] inadvertently let slip, you inquire as to who 'Vengar' is, and why Roxy being his ex makes it so that [axel.name] has to put up with her.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(You mean you don't know who Vengar is?)] [axel.name] asks, before nervously glancing around to make sure that nobody's eavesdropping on your conversation. Convinced that it's safe to talk, he steps a little closer towards you and continues, [axel.speech(I guess you'll just end up going around asking questions elsewhere if I don't explain it to you, so I'll tell you who Vengar is. He likes to keep a low profile, so please don't mention to anyone that it was me who told you about him, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You can tell from the tone of [axel.name]'s voice that he's scared to be talking about this 'Vengar' character, so you quickly reassure him that any information that he shares with you will remain a secret. Put at ease by your words, the albino [axel.race] lets out a small sigh, before once again glancing around to check for eavesdroppers, and then starting to explain.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Vengar's the leader of the largest and most dangerous criminal gang down here in Submission,)] he reveals, [axel.speech(He and his rat-morph followers extort all of the business owners down here, and those who refuse to pay protection money either have their premises vandalised, or even worse, are sometimes beaten up or even go missing. Thanks to how successful my business has been, Vengar's taken a personal interest in me, and keeps on demanding more and more protection money every month. It's gotten almost to the point where I'm going to have to shut the Gambling Den down...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Can't the Enforcers do anything?)] you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(I've already tried talking to them about it, but they say they don't have the manpower to guard my business, and while Vengar <i>is</i> a wanted criminal, he's proving impossible to track down and arrest,)] [axel.name] sighs, [axel.speech(So there's nothing anyone can do to help, and that's about the whole story...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		It sounds as though [axel.name] doesn't want to talk about this any more, but if you wanted to get involved, you suppose you could always offer to help track down Vengar and put a stop to his extortion of Submission's business owners...

		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(Really? You'd be willing to help me out like that?)] [axel.name] asks in disbelief, [axel.speech(I wouldn't want you to risk yourself on my behalf, but if you're really serious, then you might be able to find Vengar in his gang's main hideout; they call it the 'Rat Warrens', and it's down in the South-Western tunnels here in Submission. I don't know what the password to get is, but I guess if you say you're there regarding the money I owe them, they should let you in.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling [axel.name] that you'll find Vengar and bring him to justice, you get ready to set off, but before you go, the albino [axel.race] says that he has some more advice for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.speech(You could always try to get the Enforcers to help,)] he suggests, [axel.speech(They told me that they were unable to make a move on his hideout, but maybe you could convince them to give you some backup? Oh, and I should also warn you; if you're thinking of fighting Vengar, then you need to be on the lookout for his two rat-girl bodyguards. I've never seen them myself, but Vengar said that if I ever refused to pay him, then I'd be given to them as a plaything...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[axel.name] shudders as he recalls a disturbing memory, before shaking his head and giving you a toothy smile. [axel.speech(I really appreciate your offer of help, but please don't feel obliged to put yourself in harm's way solely on my account. If you do decide to confront Vengar, just please stay safe, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling [axel.name] that you'll be careful, you wonder if you should do as he suggests and ask Claire for some help from the Enforcers. Then again, you could always try to deal with Vengar by yourself...
	</p>

	<p>
		In one corner of the Gambling Den's central atrium, several pairs of glass doors have been propped open to grant easy access to a huge, adjoining hall, which is dedicated solely to the immensely popular game of dice poker. At least fifty tables are scattered around the hall's floor, and although each one only seats two players, there are far more than a hundred people present, as around most of the tables, large crowds of onlookers have gathered around to watch ongoing games.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hall is split into three sections, with each one decorated in copper, silver, or gold. The copper section is by far the largest, and from the nearby signs, you gather that these are the tables at which the betting is lowest. The silver section is roughly half the size of the copper one, and is a place where gamblers are willing to bet considerable sums of money on the outcome of their games. Finally, the gold section is the smallest of all three, and is reserved for players willing to bet huge sums of money.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the vast majority of tables are occupied, you can spot at least one in each section which has just one player sitting at it. If you wanted to, you could walk up to one of these tables and sit down for a game, or you could walk up to one of the nearby signs to read about the rules of dice poker.

		Deciding to read the rules of dice poker before starting a game, you walk up to the nearest informative sign, and briefly scan over it...
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'>
		<b>[axel.name]'s Rules For Dice Poker</b><br/>
		1. Both players place the buy-in amount to start a game. This is [style.moneyFormat(500, span)] for [style.colourCopper(copper)] tables, [style.moneyFormat(2500, span)] for [style.colourSilver(silver)], and [style.moneyFormat(10000, span)] for [style.colourGold(gold)].<br/>
		2. Both players roll five dice each.<br/>
		3. Players can choose to increase the bet (referred to as a 'raise'), or leave the bet at the buy-in amount (referred to as a 'call').<br/>
		4. After betting is done, each player selects as many of their dice as they want to re-roll.<br/>
		5. The players re-roll their chosen dice.<br/>
		6. The ranking of each player's dice is compared to find the winner, who then takes all of the money in the pot.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'>
		<b>Results ranking (from winning to losing)</b><br/>
		1. Five of a kind: Five dice of the same value. (e.g. 33333)<br/>
		2. Four of a kind: Four dice of the same value. (e.g. 55551)<br/>
		3. High straight: Consecutive numbers starting at two. (e.g. 23456)<br/>
		4. Full house: Two dice of the same value, plus three dice of a different, same value. (e.g. 22666)<br/>
		5. Three of a kind: Three dice of the same value. (e.g. 44415)<br/>
		6. Low straight: Consecutive numbers starting at one. (e.g. 12345)<br/>
		7. Two pair: Two dice of the same value, plus two dice of a different, same value. (e.g. 55331)<br/>
		8. Pair: Two dice of the same value. (e.g. 22415)<br/>
		9. Runt: All dice of different values. (e.g. 13456)<br/><br/>
		
		If both players have the same ranking, the total value of the dice that make up their rank are compared. For example:<br/>
		Player A: 33661<br/>
		Player B: 22115<br/>
		Although both players have 'Two pair', player A wins, as the total of their ranking dice is 18 (3+3+6+6), compared to player B's 6 (2+2+1+1).<br/><br/>
		
		If both players have the same ranking, and the same value, the game is a draw, and the money in the pot is returned to each player's hand.
