	<p>
		There are at least twenty imps and alpha-imps scattered around the courtyard. A few of them are simply loitering about, but most are engaged in simple tasks such as cleaning and mending clothes, sparring with one another, or preparing and eating food. You also notice that there are a few who are openly having sex over in one corner.
	</p>
	<p>
		None of these imps seem bothered about your sudden arrival, and you assume that it's because only expected guests would be in possession of the three keys required to gain entry.

	<!-- ENTRANCE -->
	
	<htmlContent tag="ENTRANCE_RUINS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Although the entranceway is one of the few parts of the citadel that managed to avoid taking significant damage, there's a considerable amount of rubble and smashed rock piled up against the gates. As you weave your way past these obstacles, you're very careful not to touch any of it out of fear that you might trigger another collapse.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking over the cracked, rubble-strewn courtyard, you find yourself gazing at the huge, ruined archway of the main keep. One of the huge wooden doors has completely splintered into pieces, while the other looks to be straining under the weight of the crumbling masonry above. Off to your left, the citadel's well looks to have been completely crushed beneath the collapsed left-side wall of the laboratory tower. On the opposite side of the courtyard, you see rubble and smashed rock blocking the small doorway of the cell block.

	<htmlContent tag="ENTRANCE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Standing in the entranceway, you're close enough to take a good look at the huge blocks from which the gates and walls have been constructed. You see that they've been carved from the same dark black stone as the cavern's floor and walls, and, looking out across the inner courtyard, you see that the material has indeed been obtained locally, as a large portion of the far wall has been mined out.
	</p>
	<p>
		Carved into that gaping recess, there's a huge stone archway, which houses a pair of massive, iron-reinforced wooden doors. Off to the left of the courtyard, you see a well in one corner, and beside that, there sits a squat, stone tower. On the opposite side of the courtyard to this tower, the cave's wall curves inwards, and into this, a small doorway has been carved.

	<htmlContent tag="LEAVE_FORTRESS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to leave this place and return another time, you walk up to the dark stone gateway. In its surface, you see three holes, which appear to be identical to the ones on the gates' exterior.
	</p>
	<p>
		Repeating the same unlocking process that you went through when entering, the gates are soon opened, and you find yourself stepping back out into the huge, dimly-lit cavern which houses the siren's citadel. As the heavy stone gates swing shut behind you, you wonder where to go to next...

		The citadel's large stone courtyard has been levelled and carved to resemble smooth flagstones, and it makes a nice change to be walking over such an even surface compared to the uneven floor of the cavern.

		The huge, stone archway of the main keep overlooks this area, and you wonder if you should approach its massive wooden doors now, or come back another time.

		The entire left-hand side of the squat tower's wall has completely collapsed, burying the citadel's well under a pile of heavy stones and smashed masonry. If you hadn't already known that there was once a well here, you'd have no idea that there was anything of note beneath this ruined wall.

You think how it was lucky there was nobody in there at the time of collapse.

		A sturdy wooden door has been fitted to the carved-out entranceway before you. As it's been left open, you're able to peer inside without entering, allowing you to see that, within, a block of four cells have been carved out of the cave's black rock. The front and sides of each of these cells are covered by heavy iron bars, and, within each one, a straw bed and wooden bucket have been placed against the far wall.
	</p>

Long wooden tables have been placed around the area, and upon them, glass beakers and tubes are filled with dull-coloured, spoiled liquids. It's quite clear that this laboratory was the origin of the transformative potions being carried by Submission's imp gangs, although you wonder just how many of those potions were produced before you shut this place down.

Around the edge of this hall, huge stone pillars have been carved from the dark black rock, and underfoot, the same obsidian stone has been cleverly worked into large slabs, the edges of which have been decorated with angular patterns.

		The impressive architecture doesn't hold your attention for too long, however, as waiting right there in front of you are the three demons from the imp fortresses.

		Looking past these demons, you see a raised dais, and upon the top, there sits a dark stone throne. Sitting upon this seat of power is the citadel's leader, the dark siren herself. Although the rest of this huge hall is well lit by the arcane lanterns, the figure sitting upon the throne itself is curiously shrouded in shadow.

		#THEN You can't help but notice [impAlphaLeader.name] flinching at the siren's impressive introduction, but, as intimidating as she may be, you know that she's no match for your ultimate power!
		#ELSE You can't help but notice [impAlphaLeader.name] flinching at the siren's cringe-worthy introduction, and, as she describes herself as the 'destroyer of worlds', you find yourself letting out a low groan as you share in the second-hand embarrassment.
		#ENDIF
		 Looking up at the raised dais, you see the leader of these demons standing up, and as she steps forwards into the light, you find yourself looking upon a rather surprising figure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only is the siren a half-demon, just like Lilaya, she's also surprisingly small and fresh-faced. From her appearance, she definitely looks to be no older than eighteen or nineteen, and stands at a rather diminutive [units.sizes(152)] in height. Unlike all the other succubi you've seen, she's completely lacking any curvaceous, womanly parts, as not only is she almost completely flat-chested, but she also has a small ass and only slightly girly hips.
	</p>
	<p>
		As well as her diminutive physical qualities, the siren's choice of outfit is also not quite what you'd expected. She's wearing a Witch's dress, boots, and wide-brimmed hat, with a black, purple-trimmed cape to finish it off. An impressive pentagram-themed amulet is hanging around her neck, and, most curiously of all, she's got a square, white eyepatch over her right eye.
	</p>
	<p>
		Far more alarming than anything else, however, is the huge, arcane-bladed scythe that she's holding in her right hand. Although it's taller than the siren by a good foot or so, and, besides the green, ethereal blade, appears to be made out of heavy metal, the small succubus shows no sign of struggling to wield it. Smirking down at you as she sees what it is you're looking at, the siren calls out, [siren.speech(Foolish mortal! Know now who it is who will deliver unto you the humiliation of crushing defeat! I, the dark siren, shatterer of dimensions, am none other than [siren.name], Lyssieth's favoured child! If you foolishly wish to face me in battle, then first you must vanquish my demon lieutenants! ~Mwhaha!~)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she says this, the three demons start to move forwards, and you realise that you only have a moment in which to react before they attack you!

		Once again, you decide to try and confront and defeat [siren.name], and so, steeling yourself for the fight to come, you step forwards and push on the heavy wooden gates.
		#IF pc.hasStatusEffect(SE_PHYSIQUE_PERK_0)
		#THEN As you're so weak, you struggle for quite some time to get them to move, but, eventually, you manage to get them to swing open before you, allowing you to step forwards into the keep.

	</p>
	<p>
		The great stone hall looks exactly as it did the last time you were here, and is still illuminated by what must be close to a hundred arcane lanterns hanging from the high, vaulted ceiling. Around the edge of the hall, huge stone pillars have been carved from the dark black rock, and underfoot, the same obsidian stone has been cleverly worked into large slabs, the edges of which have been decorated with angular patterns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just as before, the three demon lieutenants are waiting right there in front of you. [impMalesLeader.Name] appears to be the most senior of them, as he's standing at the head, with [impAlphaLeader.name] to his right, and [impFemalesLeader.name] to his left. As the huge wooden gates swing shut behind you, he smirks and asks, [impMalesLeader.speech(Back again, [pc.race]? Didn't you learn your lesson the last time?)]

		Producing the signet ring that Elizabeth, the captain of Lyssieth's guard, gave to you, you hold it up to the light to show to [siren.name]. As she sees what it is you're holding, her defiant expression suddenly breaks, and it almost looks and sounds as though she's about to burst into tears as she screams, [siren.speech(Give that back! M-Mother would never give that to someone like you! Y-You've stolen it! <i>Give it back!</i>)]
	</p>
	<p>
		You shake your head in refusal, and, putting on your most antagonising smirk, you continue to hold the ring up in such a way that it would be easy to have it knocked from your [pc.hand]. Your provocative display causes [siren.namePos] emotions to get the better of her, and, not thinking clearly, she falls for your trick. Screaming once more to hand over her mother's ring, [npc.name] suddenly casts a weak version of the spell, 'slam', which you allow to hit your outstretched [pc.arm] and, causing you to drop the ring to the floor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Immediately, [siren.name] uses her telekinetic arcane power to pull the ring into her outstretched palm, and, letting out a triumphant laugh, she instantly puts it on. [siren.speech(~Mwhaha!~ Oh, you'll pay <i>dearly</i> for stealing mother's ring! Why, I'll... W-Wait... What is this?!)]

		[siren.speech(No!)] [siren.name] screeches, and, just before she disappears from sight, she swings her scythe around over her head, before slamming the base of the shaft onto the stone floor. Lifting up her eyepatch, she reveals that her irises are heterochromatic, and, while her left eye is green, the one that she's just revealed is glowing purple. With a maniacal laugh, she calls out, [siren.speech(Siren's call, obliterate [pc.herHim]! I'll get my reven-)]

		As [siren.name] suddenly vanishes mid-sentence, the arcane spell which she just unleashed takes effect, and a loud, piercing screech echoes out around the huge throne room. You and the three demon lieutenants all cover your ears, flinching as the reverberating wail causes the ground to rumble and shake. Thankfully, this loud noise quickly fades away, but as it does, the huge stone slabs beneath your feet start to crack and break apart. From these fissures in the floor, arcane poison starts to spew forth, and, as you start to step back towards the exit, the resonating vibrations from this powerful spell cause a huge chunk of rock to suddenly split from the ceiling, which then falls to crash directly onto the siren's vacated throne.

Huge sections of the cavern's ceiling are giving way and collapsing to the floor, causing the ground to shake and rumble underfoot as rocks and debris are sent scattering over the carved flagstones.
	</p>
	<p>
