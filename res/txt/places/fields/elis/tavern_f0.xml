	<p>
		As this is your first time entering The Red Dragon, you stop at the entrance and take a look at your new surroundings. Before you, you see that the entire of the ground floor consists of one huge room, which is filled with numerous wooden tables and chairs, and which has a long bar running along the wall on the side opposite to where you've entered. Thanks to the large wooden floorboards and overhead beams, as well as the decorative, antiquated farm equipment which is displayed on the walls, this tavern's interior has a very rustic feel to it. The smell of alcohol and good, hearty food fills the air,
		#IF((game.getHourOfDay()>=15 && game.getHourOfDay()<=23))
			 and thanks to the fact that it's currently the busy time of the day, almost all of the tables are occupied by people drinking, eating, and making merry.
		#ELSE
			 but due to the fact that it's currently the quiet time of the day, only a few of the tables are occupied by people drinking, eating, and making merry.
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Any further observation of the tavern's interior is brought to a swift and sudden end, for as you look over to your left, you see the familiar form of Meraxis happily skipping over towards you. As she approaches, she calls over to the bar, [meraxis.speech(Flash! [pc.NameIs] here! Come and say hello!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking over in the direction of the bar, you see a greater badger-morph step out from behind it. Wearing a stern expression, this badger-morph looks to be in his early forties, and as he strides over to where you and Meraxis are standing, you see that he's
		#IF(game.isMetricSizes())
			 just under six feet tall,
		#ELSE
			 about 180cm tall,
		#ENDIF
		 and has a sturdy, muscular body. His [flash.topClothing(NIPPLES)] strains to contain his wide chest and thick biceps, and as he comes to a halt before you, he speaks in a deep, gruff voice which perfectly matches his physical appearance, [flash.speech(Took you long enough to get here. So you're the one Meraxis told me about, eh? I'm Flash, the owner of this place. You're not going to try and challenge me to a duel as well, are you?)]

	#IF(pc.hasTraitActivated(PERK_CHUUNI))
		<p>
			Letting out a suitably-intimidating laugh, you strike a heroic pose and reply, [pc.speech(I am [pc.name]; the most powerful being ever to have lived! Although Meraxis might have failed to defeat you in a duel, know that you stand no chance against me!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			[flash.speech(Oh great, you're just like she is...)] Flash sighs, but before he can say anything else, Meraxis lets out one of her own laughs and interrupts him.
		</p>
		<p>
			[meraxis.speech(Mwhahaha! You think that I would lose a duel?!)] she declares in a voice loud enough to make the tavern's nearby patrons turn their heads and look. Striking a pose to match yours, she continues, [meraxis.speech(Although a formidable opponent, I defeated Flash with ease! With the price of defeat being my eternal servitude to his dark desires, I was forced to unleash my full power, against which no mortal being can triumph!)]
		</p>
	#ELSE
		<p>
			Telling Flash that you have no intention of challenging him to a duel, you introduce yourself as [pc.name], to which the badger-morphs replies, [flash.speech(Right, nice to meet you.)]
		</p>
		<p>
			[meraxis.speech(You disappoint me, my nemesis; you should have challenged Flash to a duel, as I did!)] Meraxis declares in a voice loud enough to make the tavern's nearby patrons turn their heads and look. Striking a heroic pose, she continues, [meraxis.speech(Although a formidable opponent, I defeated him with ease! With the price of defeat being my eternal servitude to his dark desires, I was forced to unleash my full power, against which no mortal being can triumph!)]
		</p>
	#ENDIF
	<p>
		[flash.speech(What do you mean, my 'dark desires'?)] Flash grunts in annoyance, before turning to you and explaining, [flash.speech(This little [meraxis.race] came barging into my tavern and challenged me to a fight in front of all my regulars. Like the damn fool I am, I accepted her terms and said that she'd have to work as one of my dish washers for a year if she lost. I didn't really care what she was demanding, as she looks so weak that I was sure the fight'd be over before it even began...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[meraxis.speech(That'll teach you to underestimate me!)] Meraxis interjects, before finishing the rest of the story by saying, [meraxis.speech(I demanded that Flash would have to surrender two rooms to me if he lost. To his credit, he dared not break our sinister contract, and after I swiftly annihilated him, he agreed to give me the two rooms which were promised!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[flash.speech(I'm not one to break my word,)] Flash grunts, [flash.speech(And besides, it'd be a fool who'd betray a recognised daughter of an elder lilin. Anyway, now that I know that [pc.name] here is the one who'll be using the other room, I've got things to do. See you around, [pc.name], and don't cause any trouble in here.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Flash turns around and walks back over to the bar, leaving Meraxis to turn towards you and declare, [meraxis.speech(Mwhahaha! As you can see, my mission to secure accommodation for you has been a success! Now I shall introduce you to my new minions, and then I shall reveal the secret path to your room!)]

	<htmlContent tag="FIRST_ENTRY_MINIONS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Curious to find out what Meraxis means by her 'minions', and relying on her to show you to your room, you follow the chuuni [meraxis.race] as she skips across to one corner of the tavern. Several sofas and low coffee tables have been arranged in this area, and lounging about on a couple of these seats are half a dozen scantily-dressed succubi. As they see Meraxis approach they immediately start fawning over her, with the nearest one even asking if she'd would like to use her as a foot stool.
	</p>
	<p>
		[meraxis.speech(Silence, minions!)] Meraxis declares, before doing a complete spin on the spot and striking a rather unblanced-looking pose. Letting out a brief laugh, she introduces you by declaring, [meraxis.speech(This is [pc.name]; my arch-nemesis!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Taking Meraxis's words far too seriously, the succubi all start angrily glaring at you, before one of them asks the [meraxis.race] if she'd like them to attack you. Laughing in response, Meraxis defuses the situation by explaining, [meraxis.speech(I am the one fated to defeat [pc.name]! None of you would stand a chance against [pc.her] supreme might, so don't even try!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning towards you, Meraxis then explains, [meraxis.speech(My minions here witnessed my supreme power as I effortlessly defeated Flash in a duel outside this very tavern. Realising that I am none other than Lyssieth's recognised daughter, and seeing my ultimate arcane mastery for themselves, these succubi have pledged themselves to be my minions!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking back over towards these succubi, you realise that they must be wanting to move up Elis's social hierarchy by being associated with a recognised daughter of an elder lilin. Before you can ask them if this is their intention, however, Meraxis grabs hold of your [pc.arm(true)] and pulls you away, saying, [meraxis.speech(Come on, [pc.name], I shall reveal to you the hidden paths which lead to your new evil lair!)]
	</p>

	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="FIRST_ENTRY_ROOM"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Internally translating Meraxis's words as meaning that she wants to show you to your new room, you allow her to pull you along after her as she crosses the tavern and heads towards a corridor that leads off from one side of the bar. Travelling down this short passageway, you're then led up a spiral staircase and down yet another corridor, before finally arriving at a locked door. Pointing down to the end of the corridor, Meraxis reveals, [meraxis.speech(My own dark lair is there; right next to yours. If I'm in there, it means I'm sleeping, which I usually do from about one to nine in the morning, so don't disturb me unless there's an emergency, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Replying in the affirmative, you take the key which Meraxis then hands to you, before listening as the chuuni [meraxis.race] reveals, [meraxis.speech(I've also done the other thing mommy asked of me; I've gone and met Minotallys and told her that you want to meet her about the situation with Lunette. I know we've also got the plan of getting help from the youko, but we can think about that after your meeting with Minotallys. Just let me know when you're ready to go and meet with her!)]

	<htmlContent tag="FIRST_ENTRY_ROOM_END"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Thanking Meraxis for all that she's done, you can't help but smile as the [meraxis.race] blushes a little and proclaims, [meraxis.speech(Yes, well, I <i>am</i> the greatest, so it's only natural for me to have got all of this sorted for you! Anyway, come and find me if you feel brave enough to challenge me to a duel, my nemesis! I shall surely deliver a crushing defeat upon you! Mwhahaha!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With that, Meraxis spins around, and with a theatrical swish of her cloak, she runs off down the corridor, leaving you to unlock the door to your new room and head inside to take a look...

	<htmlContent tag="BAR"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Situated against the far wall, the long, wooden bar before you serves as the source of food and drink for the tavern's patrons. The shelves behind this bar are stocked full of a dazzling array of bottles and glasses, and right in the middle of them there's a large chalkboard which lists the meals that are being served today. At the bottom of this blackboard, a large sign clearly reads: 'Alcohol and Hot food <b>only</b> served between
		#IF(game.getHourOfDay()<8)
			 [style.colourMinorBad([units.time(8)]-[units.time(0)])].'
		#ELSE

		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(game.getCharactersPresent().contains(flash))
			#IF((game.getHourOfDay()>=15 && game.getHourOfDay()<=23))
				As this is the busiest time of day, there are a couple of employees behind the bar, with Flash himself joining them in serving drinks to the customers.
			#ELSE
				As this is the busiest time of day, the only person working at the bar is Flash, who's in the middle of serving a customer.
			#ENDIF
			 This greater badger-morph has a stern expression on his face, and as he turns to place a freshly-poured pint of beer on the counter, you estimate that he must be in his early forties. Standing at

				 just under six feet tall,
			#ELSE
				 about 180cm tall,
			#ENDIF
			 Flash has a sturdy, muscular body, and as he looks around to see who's going to be his next customer, you see his [flash.topClothing(NIPPLES)] straining to contain his wide chest and thick biceps. If you wanted to order a drink or something to eat, you could quite easily get his attention.
		#ELSE
			Due to the current hour, you suppose that Flash must be sleeping in his room upstairs, as there's only one badger-boy employee to be seen working behind the bar. He looks to be engaged in idle talk with one of the establishment's regular customers, although if you wanted to order a drink or something to eat, you could quite easily get his attention. However, due to the fact that the kitchen is closed at this time, and that alcohol isn't being served, your choices will be somewhat limited...
		#ENDIF

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to pass some time, you engage Flash in conversation, asking him whether anything of note has happened in the local area recently. Although his stern expression doesn't soften, the badger-boy seems to be more than happy to talk with you, and tells you what's been happening in Elis over the past few days. While none of it is particularly interesting, you do enjoy spending your time talking with Flash, and so after he's exhausted his knowledge of local affairs, you move on to asking him what he thinks of the recent weather.
	</p>
	<p>
		After you've finished discussing the weather, you move on to talking about a wide range of trivial matters, and in this manner the two of you continue idly talking with one another for quite some time. Although he's sometimes interrupted by a customer who wants to place an order, Flash always swiftly returns to continue your conversation, and before you know it you've spent fifteen minutes making small talk.
	</p>
	<p>
		The arrival of a large group of customers at the bar signals an end to your conversation, and after telling you that he enjoyed your talk, Flash steps over to start taking their orders, leaving you wondering what to do next...

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_MERAXIS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to know what Flash's opinion of Meraxis is, you get his attention and ask him what he thinks about the chuuni [meraxis.race]. Letting out a deep sigh, he grunts, [flash.speech(I guess she's not really too bad. I've only got myself to blame for agreeing to fight her. I had no idea she was the daughter of an elder lilin at the time...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Asking Flash what happened, you listen as he recalls, [flash.speech(Well, she burst into my tavern and starting shouting that she was here to challenge the owner, which would be me, to a duel. She looked so weak that most of the regulars at the bar burst out laughing, and they told her that she'd stand no chance against me. I'm not known to act in a reckless manner, but with all of my regulars telling me to deal with her, and Meraxis continuing to throw out challenges and insults at me, I foolishly agreed to fight her.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With the badger-boy now at the most interesting part of the story, you wait for him to quickly serve a waiting customer, and then listen as he continues, [flash.speech(So, she was demanding that I'd surrender two rooms to her if she won, and so I said she'd have to work as a dish washer for a year if she lost. We went outside to have this 'duel', and she suddenly pulled out a huge scythe from mid-air. That's when I knew I'd fucked up... Pardon my language... I thought I'd just grab her and shake her about a bit until she surrendered, but before I even knew what was happening she was swinging that huge thing at me and casting all manner of spells. I couldn't land even one hit on her before I was on my back...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she'd done this to secure accommodation for you, you can't help but feel somewhat responsible for Meraxis's behaviour. Asking Flash if the loss of two rooms is a serious problem for him, you're surprised to see a big smile break out across the badger-boy's face, and he chuckles as he replies, [flash.speech(Losing those two rooms is a small price to pay for what I've gained from all this. Sure, my ego took a beating and I lost a bit of respect from my regulars, but I was fortunate enough to have our duel witnessed by those succubbi.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Flash motions over towards Meraxis's corner, and you look over to see what she calls her 'minions' lounging about on the sofas. Leaning down over the counter, Flash lowers his voice and reveals, [flash.speech(Those succubi are recognised daughters of one lilin or another, and they're not only what passes for the social elite here in Elis, but they're also filthy rich. They can be a little demanding on my staff, but between them they spend far more than I ever earned from renting those two rooms out upstairs.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Standing up straight again, Flash concludes, [flash.speech(So I don't harbour any ill-will towards Meraxis. She's not a bad girl, and so long as she thinks that she's the most important person in the room, she's surprisingly polite and well-mannered.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment, several customers step up to the bar and call for Flash to serve them. With your conversation having reached its end, the badger-boy gives you a nod and steps over to start taking their orders, leaving you wondering what to do next...

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_LUNETTE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Curious to find out what Flash knows of Lunette, you get his attention and ask him if he's ever had dealings with the elder lilin or her demonic centaurs. Letting out a sigh, he replies, [flash.speech(Thankfully, I've never run into her or any of her thugs; I'd moved here to Elis long before she started to really get out of control.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Sensing a slightly angry tone in the badger-boy's voice, you push him a little and ask him what his opinion of Lunette is. Shaking his head, he grunts, [flash.speech(As everyone with any sense will tell you, she's pure evil. My extended family were driven out of our ancestral clan sett by her centaur thugs. Luckily, I was in a position here in Elis to get them jobs either here at the tavern or elsewhere in the town, but we'll never forgive or forget Lunette for what she's done.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As he talks, Flash's voice starts to sound angrier and angrier, and you decide that it would be best to drop the subject for now. As the badger-boy steps over to serve another customer, you wonder how many other people in Elis are victims of Lunette's indiscriminate raiding. Letting out a sigh and looking around the tavern, you wonder what to do next...

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_MINOTALLYS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to know what Flash has to say about the town's mayor, you get his attention and ask him what he knows of Minotallys. Shrugging his shoulders, he reveals, [flash.speech(Truth be told, I don't really know much about her other than what's common knowledge. She's supposed to be kind and considerate, but whatever her personality's like, I can tell you that her policies of low taxation and limited regulation are very popular amongst those of us who run businesses. Of course, there's only so much she can do within the confines of the laws of the Realm, but I think that most of Elis's residents would agree that she's a strong force for good in this town.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Curious to find out if Flash has ever met Minotallys, you ask him if his role as one of Elis's business owners has ever brought him into contact with her. Nodding his head, he confirms, [flash.speech(Yes, I've met her a few times during meetings for business owners, but as I said, I still don't know much about her. During those meetings it was mainly her assistant who was doing the talking, and I couldn't ask Minotallys any questions directly, so I didn't get to find out what she's really like.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Asking Flash about Minotallys's assistant, you listen as he explains, [flash.speech(Yeah, 'Arion' is his name; he's an alicorn, and one who's particularly adept at harnessing the arcane from what I hear. There's no doubt that he's extremely intelligent and competent at his job, but he struck me as being a bit over-protective of Minotallys. He insisted that he was simply carrying out the instructions of his boss, but I wonder how much influence he really has over this town's management...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment a particularly demanding customer draws Flash's attention, and as your conversation was already coming to an end, he gives you a curt nod and steps over to deal with them, leaving you wondering what to do next...
	</p>

	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_HISTORY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to find out about Flash's history, you catch his attention and ask him how he came to own this tavern. After spending a moment wondering where to start, the badger-boy says, [flash.speech(Well, I used to run a tavern similar to this one out in the Fields, a short distance from where my family's sett was. I eventually decided that I wanted to do something new, so I left my old tavern in the hands of one of my younger brothers and moved here to Elis.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After then being briefly interrupted by a customer asking for service, Flash steps back over to you and resumes his story, [flash.speech(I didn't intend to take over this place, but I guess fate wanted me to continue running a tavern... When I arrived in Elis, I decided to rent a room for a few days here in The Red Dragon, and it was while I was staying here that the owner, who was a tired old sheep-boy, revealed to me that he wanted to sell this place and go travelling. I decided to help him out and offered to buy this place from him, and a few days later I was the new owner and he was setting off on his travels.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Curious to find out more about the tavern's previous owner, you ask Flash what this sheep-boy was like, to which he responds, [flash.speech(Well, as I say, he was getting on in years and seemed to be pretty fed up with running this place. I found out that he was a direct descendant of the sheep-boy who originally built this tavern several centuries ago. The story goes that this original sheep-boy was an ordinary farmer, and then one day a huge, red dragon appeared and offered him a great pile of golden treasure. All the farmer had to do in exchange was hand over his tools and teach this dragon how to farm, if you can believe that! Of course, the farmer agreed, and with his new fortune he had this tavern built. That's how this place got its name, from the red dragon in the story.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Wanting to know what became of the tavern's previous owner, you ask Flash if he ever returned to Elis. Shaking his head, the badger-boy reveals, [flash.speech(He never returned, no. That was over five years ago now. He told me that he wanted to travel up into the mountains of the moon and try to find the red dragon who gave his ancestor his fortune. Dragons can live for a very long time, from what I understand, so I suppose it's not entirely unreasonable to think that this red dragon might still be alive up there. Well, whatever the case may be, there's been no word of the previous owner of this place, nor of the red dragon.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanking Flash for the information, you wonder what to do next...

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_YOUKO"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to find out if Flash knows anything about the youko who live in the Shinrin Highlands, you catch his attention and ask him if he's ever had dealings with them. Shaking his head, he replies, [flash.speech(Although it's very rare, we do sometimes get a youko or two passing through here, but they almost always keep to themselves. I've never been into the highlands, but from what I've heard from customers who have, then running into a youko can either be the best or worst thing to ever happen to you.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment a pair of demanding customers interrupt Flash, and you're forced to wait as the badger-boy quickly deals with them. Returning to you, he continues, [flash.speech(Sorry about that. Anyway, as I was saying, apparently the youko will sometimes bestow gifts and knowledge upon travellers, and even provide them with a safe place to rest. Other times, they'll lead you on a wild goose chase through the forest, taunting and laughing at you the whole time. Someone passed through here a few weeks ago who'd been on the receiving end of that; he didn't say a word to anyone the whole time he was here, but one of his friends he was with told me that he'd been trapped in the youko's forest for almost two years, and had to survive on scraps of food thrown to him by his tormentors. If you're thinking of going into the Shinrin Highlands, I'd advise you not to do it unless you've got a guide...)]

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_JESS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to know what Flash can tell you about Jess, you call him over and ask him about the alluring fox-girl. Shaking his head, he grunts, [flash.speech(Sorry, but out of respect for her privacy, I can't tell you much about her. All I can say is that I've given her permission to work here, so long as she doesn't give this place a bad reputation.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Pointing out that he's also given her a room upstairs, you ask Flash if he has a soft spot for fox-girls. Letting out a laugh, he replies, [flash.speech(No, it's nothing like that, and we don't have any familial relation to one another either. I just found myself in a position where I had to take responsibility for her. That's all there is to it.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Realising that Flash isn't going to tell you anything about Jess, you suppose that the only information you'll be able to find out about her is that which she'll tell you directly. Thanking Flash for his time, you wonder what to do next...

		At that moment, the fox-girl lets out a genuine laugh, and admits, [jess.speech(Ok, I'm making it sound more theatrical than it really was; I grabbed my stuff and ran out into the street before those two could carry out their plan. At first I thought I'd head east like everyone else who's sick of Dominion; apparently there's a boat at the coast which takes you to a new land, but I've never been good around water. I thought I may as well try my luck in another city in the Realm, and at the flip of a coin I chose Elis to be my destination.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Interested in Jess's story, you ask her what her journey here was like, to which she sighs and replies, [jess.speech(Well, all this happened as Lunette's raiding was really getting crazy. I think I had to stop and offer freebies to her demonic centaurs five times... or was it six? Anyway, it was nothing I hadn't done before. The thing which really hurt was when they took all my money. I arrived at Elis with nothing but the clothes on my back... 'Course, those were soon coming off as I set about earning a living in the alleyways to the north of the town.)]

Luckily for me, they're nowhere near as brutal as those in Dominion, and instead of enslaving me they gave me a fine and warned me not to be caught whoring myself out again. Unluckily for me, that fine took away everything I'd earned... At that point I got really desperate, and snuck in to the kitchen here at this tavern to try and steal some food.)]

		Feeling as though she's coming to the end of her story, you ask Jess if that's when she first met Flash. At the mention of his name, a big smile breaks out across the fox-girl's face, and she confirms, [jess.speech(That's right! One of the staff here saw me stealing some bread, and they chased me out through the tavern, right into the arms of the same Enforcers who'd fined me the day before. 'Course, Flash, being the big softie he really is, insisted on knowing what the Enforcers planned on doing to me. When they said I was going to be enslaved for a year or so, he said that he didn't want to press charges, and that he'd take responsibility for making sure I didn't cause trouble in the town again. After hearing what I'd been through, he offered me a deal; I don't do anything to give The Red Dragon a bad reputation, and he not only lets me work here, but also lets me rent a room <i>and</i> gives me three square meals a day.

Letting out a delighted, muffled moan in response, the sexy fox-girl presses her [jess.cupSize]-cup breasts against you as she leans in to passionately return your kiss.

	</p>
	<p>
		Leaning forwards and continuing to desperately kiss you, Jess takes hold of your [pc.hands] and guides them up under her sweater. Giving her what she wants, you start groping and squeezing the fox-girls big boobs as she makes out with you in your lap.

	<p>
		Caught up in your intimate embrace, the two of you spend the next fifteen minutes making out with one another in this manner, before you finally decide to pull back and do something else with Jess...

		Deciding to take Jess up on her offer, you slip your [pc.hand(true)] down between her legs and start tracing your [pc.fingers] over her lacy thong. Letting out an excited squeal, Jess curls her fluffy fox-tail up so as to conceal her groin from the rest of the room. Leaning in to you, she teases, [jess.speech(Go on, shift them aside... ~Mmm!~ I want you to feel how wet I'm getting...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		More than happy to do as she asks, you shift Jess's lacy thong aside, before teasing your [pc.fingers] over her [jess.labia+]. Taking a moment to play with her sensitive little clit, and causing Jess to let out a series of horny little moans in the process, you slide your touch down and sink your [pc.fingers] into her wet cunt. Bucking her hips against you, Jess leans in to once again suggest, [jess.speech(I can let you do far more than this, you know... ~Aah!~ Just two thousand flames, and the two of us can be up in my room... ~Mmm!~ I'll let you fuck me however you like, [pc.name]...)]

Flashing you a delighted smile, the fox-girl takes hold of your [pc.hand(true)] and teases, [jess.speech(Come on then, let me give you the full tour of my room...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Allowing her to lead you across the tavern and up the stairs, you soon find yourself at teh door to Jess's bedroom. Producing a key from out of her purse, she unlocks the door and leads you inside, where you see that the fox-girl's room is painted in a very feminine shade of pink. The double-size bed looks to have been recently and smartly made with fresh, clean white sheets, while a wooden desk, wardrobe, and chest of drawers constitute the remainder of the room's furniture. Posters of scantily-clad fashion icons are hung up on the walls, with some of them even being enchanted so as to make their subjects move and blow you the occasional kiss.
	</p>
	<p>
		Locking the door behind you, Jess strides over the wooden floor to pull the blinds half-closed, granting the two of you complete privacy. Turning to seductively bite her lip at you, the fox-girl curls her tail up and strokes it as she asks, [jess.speech(So, [pc.name], do you want to take the lead, or would you rather submit to me?)]

		#IF((game.getHourOfDay()>=15 && game.getHourOfDay()<=23))
