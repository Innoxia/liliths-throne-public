		Starting off as no more than just a grey strip on the horizon, the silhouette of Elis gets larger and larger as you approach. Soon enough you're able to pick out the distinctive shape of towers embedded into the corners of the ramparts, as well as the roofs of the taller buildings within the town itself. The one which stands out the most, and the one which truly defines the town's silhouette, is the tall, highly-steepled roof of the town hall's tower.

	<p>
		Deciding to leave Elis, you set off on your journey away from the town. After about half an hour of travelling, and with Elis being no more than a grey strip off in the distance, you find yourself back out in the Foloi Fields...

	<htmlContent tag="ALLEY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The northern half of Elis is quite unlike the rest of the town, as it's home to an intricate, twisting network of narrow alleyways. Permanently cast in shade from the ramshackle buildings teetering precariously overhead, the cobblestone which the ground is pathed in is poorly maintained and filled with potholes and puddles.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite their claustrophobic nature and the dilapidated state of the surrounding structures, these alleyways don't have the same dangerous feeling to them as those in Dominion, largely due to the fact that there's always at least a few harmless residents either loitering about or travelling past you. There are also numerous clotheslines linking the buildings above your head, and the bright colours of the clothing hung out to dry helps to lend a cheery atmosphere to what would otherwise be some very drab surroundings.
	</p>
	<p>
		While you're confident that these alleyways are safe to be travelling through, you can't help but notice how they're home to the town's more disreputable elements. Thanks to the fact that there's a backalley brothel or a sleazy gambling den never more than a few turns away, you find yourself often having to filter out the sounds of whorish moaning or drunken laughter as you travel ever onwards...

	<htmlContent tag="BANK"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Excluding the town hall, the Bank of Elis can confidently make the claim that it's housed in the largest and most impressive building within the entire town. In stark contrast to the medieval aesthetic of the surrounding timber-framed structures, the building before you is made out of large blocks of pale stone. With a frontage consisting of huge columns holding up a steepled roof, it's a perfect example of neoclassical architecture.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whether due to a lawful requirement, or simply to display their loyalty to the public, a pair of identical flags hang down on either side of the bank's entrance, each of which carries the black pentagram of Lilith. Looking between these flags, 
		#IF(game.getDayOfWeek()==DOW_SUNDAY)
			#IF((game.getHourOfDay()<10 || game.getHourOfDay()>15))

	<htmlContent tag="CULT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Positioned on the western side of town, one otherwise-ordinary building stands out from those around it due to the copious amount of flags which hang from its windows. With each one bearing the black pentagram of Lilith, the fanatical loyalty of the building's occupants is apparent to anyone who so much as glances its way.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason for this unusual display isn't hard to figure out, for there's a large sign over the building's entrance which reads: 'Cult of Lilith; Elis Headquarters'. A pair of attractive succubi handing out promotional pamphlets are stationed to either side of the entrance, and as they see you looking in their general direction, one of them flashes you a disarming smile and beckons you forwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		You're not sure if you want to get caught up in the cult's affairs at the moment, so you break eye contact with the succubus and prepare to continue on your way...

	<htmlContent tag="ENFORCERS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		While nowhere near as huge or imposing as its Dominion counterpart, the building which houses the Elis Enforcers is nevertheless a suitably large and official-looking one. Although it's of the same timber-framed style as most of the other structures in the town, the Enforcer station differs from those around it by nature of the fact that it sits back from the road, and is separated from where you're standing by an attractive knot garden. If it wasn't for the large sign declaring this to be the Enforcer's Elis branch, as well as the Enforcers themselves occasionally coming and going from the main entrance, you could easily be mistaken for thinking that this building was simply a wealthy resident's manor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly not having to deal with anywhere near the same level of crime as the Realm's capital, the Enforcers which you see all have a relaxed, friendly look about them. Not having any business with the Enforcers at this time, you don't see any need to engage one in conversation and discover if that friendly appearance is simply skin deep, and so turn around and prepare to continue on your way...

			<b>The Farmer's Market; Open every day</b>

			<b>History</b>
			<br/>
			Did you know that the town of Elis started right here where you're standing? That's right, before there was a town at all, Elis was no more than a tiny hamlet and a livestock market. Despite its position on the outskirts of the Foloi Fields, Elis rose to become the region's largest and most prosperous town, and it was all thanks to this very market!
			<br/><br/>
			But how did that happen, you ask? Well, the answer's an easy one! The youko of the nearby Shinrin Highlands, who up until a hundred or so years ago had mostly kept to themselves, started using the market here at Elis as a way to obtain food and drink which they otherwise didn't have access to. With the youko's considerable arcane abilities sometimes being offered in exchange for goods, the tiny hamlet of Elis was able to embark on several ambitious construction projects, allowing it to quickly grow into a thriving village!
			<br/><br/>
			And what next? I'm glad you asked! From there, the village continued to grow, with this very market continuing to be the focal point. Unfortunately, the village's new-found prosperity attracted the attention of bandits. Striking from out of the Foloi Forests, they brought Elis to the brink of utter ruin. It was only thanks to the help of a mysterious youko, who built the first walls of Elis, that everything you see around you was made possible!
			<br/><br/>
			Over time, the village of Elis grew into a town, although despite the size of our settlement, the threat of bandit raids has never gone away. Due to this, the walls had to be expanded to the north, and have since been filled with new buildings and fellow residents! And the market which started off as a field beside a tiny hamlet has expanded into the one before your eyes; the best market in all of Lilith's Realm!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<b>Today's Market</b>
			<br/>
			The market as it exists today offers everything you could possibly ever need! From food and drink to entertainment (and maybe even love?), it's the best place for both shopping and relaxation.
			<br/><br/>
			The market is open every day, between [units.time(8)]-[units.time(18)]. Please note that a large part of the market is used as a traditional livestock market on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
		</p>
		<p style='text-align:center; font-size:0.75em'>

	<htmlContent tag="POND"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		A short distance from the southern walls of Elis, a large pond can be found, and its in front of this pool of still water that you find yourself standing. Choked by algae and with thick bushes of tall reeds growing all around its perimeter, this body of water looks, and smells, more like a swamp than a pond. What little of the murky green water which you're able to see through the blanket of algae looks extremely uninviting, and you can't imagine that many creatures are able to survive in a place such as this.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the absence of any sign of fauna, there are a few warning signs scattered about near to the pond's edges. Other than advising you not to swim in the water, these signs also warn of a 'pond monster' which has been known to attack people who linger beside the murky water for too long. Almost as if to prove to you that the sign's warning should be heeded, ripples suddenly start spreading over the pond's surface, the size of which look to be far too large to have been formed by a simple fish or frog.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unless you want to run the risk of being attacked by the 'pond monster' which calls this fetid, swampy pond its home, you'd better leave...

		Although Elis has most of its commercial needs met by its large farmer's market, there still exists a need for more permanent stores, and it's within the town's open-air shopping precinct that this need is met.

	<p>
		Likely due to the original owner's business acumen, 'The Red Dragon' tavern is one of the first buildings to be seen by people entering Elis via the eastern gate. Although it's of a similar timber-framed design to those around it, this two-story tavern is at least twice their length, and despite whatever age it might be, looks to be an impressive example of late medieval architecture. It's due to this size that the tavern has two entrances, both of which display the opening times as being twenty four hours a day, seven days of the week.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tavern's main sign hangs from a pole which juts out from the building's upper floor, and displays a stylised image of a huge red dragon giving a pile of golden treasure to a bewildered-looking sheep-boy. Beneath this, the words 'The Red Dragon' are painted in a dark burgundy hue. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Through the tavern's leaded windows, you can see that the
		#IF(!game.isDayTime())
			 well-lit
		#ENDIF
		 interior is
		#IF((game.getHourOfDay()>=15 && game.getHourOfDay()<=23))
			 very busy, and the typical sounds of drunken revelry which spill out into the street inform you that the patrons are having a good time.
		#ELSE
			 not particularly busy, although there are still several patrons sitting at some of the tables or leaning against the wooden bar.
		#ENDIF
		 If you wanted to, you could head inside and take a look around...

	<htmlContent tag="TAVERN_SEEDY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		An oddity in amongst the narrow alleyways of the northern half of Elis, the large, paved courtyard in front of you is filled with wooden picnic tables, at which a dozen or so locals are sitting and passing the hours by drinking and gambling with one another. The establishment responsible for their supply of alcohol is situated on the far side of the courtyard, and takes the form of a rather dilapidated timber-framed structure. A weathered sign precariously hanging from a sagging metal pole displays an image of two crossed daggers, with the words 'The Crossed Blades' written in black, bold letting below.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the patrons who're sitting out in the courtyard seem to be relatively well-behaved, there are some very rowdy sounds of laughter, cursing, and the occasional cheer coming from within the pub itself. Although there are large, leaded windows on the ground floor, they're so grimy that
		#IF(game.isDayTime())
			 you can't see much of the interior through them, 
		#ELSE
			 you can only barely tell that the lights are on inside,
		#ENDIF
		 and so if you wanted to find out what this pub is like, you'll have to risk heading inside...

	<htmlContent tag="TAVERN_TAUR"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Positioned on the street corner directly adjacent to the farmer's market, 'The Centaur's Sword' tavern occupies three interlinked two-story buildings. Prominently displayed beside its remarkably-wide entrance, an information board declares this tavern to have a 'taur-friendly interior design' and a bar that's able to 'accommodate more than a dozen centaurs'.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tavern's sign hangs from a purpose-built post situated a few [style.lSizes] away from the main entrance, and displays an image of a naked, muscular centaur showing off his enormous erection. The words 'The Centaur's Sword' are written beneath this in flowing gold script, while an additional sign hanging beneath that reads 'Open 24/7'.
	</p>
	<p>
		The sounds of laughter and the distinctive stomping of hoofs on wooden floorboards can quite clearly be heard from where you're standing, letting you know that the tavern's occupants are having a good time. Looking through the leaded windows, you see that there are a large number of taurs at the bar, and you wonder whether to head inside and take a look around...

	<htmlContent tag="TOWER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Constructed out of the same large, stone blocks as the connecting walls, this square tower is three stories tall. A wide, spiral staircase links all three of its floors, as well as providing access to the flat wooden platform which serves as the roof. Unlike the town's walls, this tall vantage point is manned by a member of the town guard, who's able to look over the crenellated walls and survey the surrounding landscape for any sign of approaching bandits or raiders.
	</p>
	<p>
		Access to this tower is completely unrestricted, and there seems to always be at least one member of the public who's decided to travel up to the top in order to enjoy the view or keep the guard company. With little to keep you here, you quickly find yourself leaving the tower behind as you continue on your way...

Smoothly landing on a flat, clear patch of land, you look around and wonder where to go from here...

	<htmlContent tag="TOWN_HALL"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Consisting of two long, timber-framed buildings joined in the middle by a five-story, steepled tower, the town hall is by far the largest structure in all of Elis. Serving as the centre of administration not only for the town itself but also a significant portion of the Foloi Fields, the town hall has very long opening hours, which are listed beside each of its many entrances as being
		#IF((game.getHourOfDay()<7 || game.getHourOfDay()>21))
			 [style.colourMinorBad([units.time(7)]-[units.time(21)])].

		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF((game.getHourOfDay()<7 || game.getHourOfDay()>21))
			Due to the fact that it's currently [style.colourBad(closed)] to members of the public, all of the doors are firmly shut and locked, and only a couple of lights can be seen to still be on in some of the rooms on the upper floors. If you wanted to enter the town hall, you'll have to come back during opening hours...
		#ELSE
			Due to the fact that it's currently [style.colourGood(open)] to members of the public, you can witness the odd person heading in or out of the building. If you wanted to, you could follow their example and make use of one of the door signposted as the public entrance to head inside...

	<htmlContent tag="WALL"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		While they seem to be very strong and sturdy from the outside, the walls of Elis are not particularly impressive from up close. Although the stone blocks from which these walls are constructed are very large, there's only a single layer of them, with the stairs, ramparts, and supporting scaffolding being made out of thick beams of wood. Standing at a little over two-stories tall, they're large enough to stop any force short of a well-prepared army, and so even despite their relative weakness, these walls are able to completely protect the residents of Elis from bandits and Lunette's raiders.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to there being no imminent threat of attack, there are no guards or Enforcers manning the parapets, and with no signs prohibiting access to members of the public, you're able to freely head up and travel along the wide, wooden walkway. Although there's a road running parallel to the wall, it seems a lot more interesting to travel along this elevated platform, which seems to be the opinion of several other residents of Elis, who have similarly decided to take the high road.

	<htmlContent tag="WOOD_HUT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Looking over to the edge of the nearby woodland, you see what must be the only residential structure to be found outside of the walls of Elis. Taking the form of a single-story log cabin, this modest dwelling looks to be occupied, as a lazy stream of thin white smoke rises from its single metal chimney.
	</p>
	<p>
		A short distance away from this cabin sits a very large, open-sided storage shed, which you can see is mostly filled with chopped logs. The only remaining space inside this shed is taken up by a section of tree trunk, which looks to be used as a chopping block due to the fact that a large wood-cutting axe has been sunk into it at a low angle. A sign nailed to the wall of this shed reads: 'Firewood for sale. Deliveries available. Please knock.'
	</p>
	<p>
		Although you don't have much of a need for firewood, there's nothing stopping you from knocking on the log cabin's door and introducing yourself...

				 Thanks to the safety offered by the close proximity of Elis, you can take the time to truly appreciate the woodland's spring-time beauty. Small, leafy shoots are mixed in amongst the many trees' blossoms, and in the light of day, these woods have an almost enchanted feel to it.

			#ELSEIF(game.getSeason()==SEASON_AUTUMN)
				 Thanks to the safety offered by the close proximity of Elis, you can take the time to truly appreciate the woodland's autumnal beauty. The canopy's countless leaves are casting the light of day into a mottled orange, brown, and red, and with the faint smell of mulch, as well as the slight chill in the air, you can definitely feel that winter is not too far away.

An odd owl's hoot or distant wolf's howl leaves you wondering if a wild animal is close by, and every time there's a gentle rustle of wind in the branches, you have to stop and listen to make sure that nothing's sneaking up on you.
