		The structure before you is the only one in the shopping precinct that's of a single-story, and is also unique in the fact that it's separated from the street by a paved courtyard. An extension to the building's roof has been constructed so as to shelter most of this courtyard from the rain, and it's beneath this cover that several furnaces and anvils are situated. A hand-crafted metal sign hangs from the edge of this roof extension, and bears the words: 'The Ninth Strike; Arcane Blacksmith'

The black-furred one is using a pair of tongs to hold and turn a piece of red-hot metal, while his grey-furred companion is tirelessly hammering it into what looks like the shape of a sword. These goat-boys are so engrossed in their work that they haven't seen you approach, and you wonder whether you should interrupt them and inquire about what they have for sale or instead leave them to their smithing and come back at another time...

			<b>Wall's End</b>
			<br/>
			Standard Opening Times: [units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)]
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>History</b>
			<br/>
			How did this shopping precinct come into being? Why is it called 'Wall's End'? And why is it needed when the farmer's market already exists? Woah, so many questions! Thankfully, all three can be answered by recounting a little of our wonderful town's history!
			<br/><br/>
			As you might already know, in the past our town was just a village, although a village that was destined to grow into the best town in all of Lilith's Realm. Of course, as with any growing population, Elis soon had need of commercial premises which couldn't be accommodated by simple market stalls. As such, our wonderful mayor, Minotallys, decreed that a shopping precinct needed to be created.
			<br/><br/>
			This decision coincided with the most ambitious construction project Elis has ever seen. Known to the locals as 'the northern expansion', a portion of the defensive walls needed to be torn down and rebuilt so as to accommodate an entirely new district. Where you're standing right now is where that northern wall once stood, hence it was agreed that this shopping precinct should honour that history by being called 'Wall's End'!
			<br/><br/>
			I hope that answers your questions, and now you can get to shopping! Make sure to spend lots of money to help keep our economy ticking!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<b>Businesses</b>
			<br/>
			Here at Wall's End we've got a convenience store, a place for clothes shopping, and even a massage parlour! Who needs to go to Dominion when you've got everything you could ever need right here?!
			<br/><br/>
			Most businesses are open six days a week, between [units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)]. The convenience store is open 24/7, however, so even if it's the middle of the night there's no reason for you not to come in and take a look around!

		In the very middle of Wall's End, facing the entrance, there's a large statue of the town's mayor, Minotallys. Expertly carved from white marble, this depiction of the town's favourite minotauress is wearing nothing except the jewellery which adorns her horns, fingers, and tail.
	</p>
	<p>
		With a playful grin on her face, this marble mimicry of Minotallys is using one hand to cover her pussy, while her other arm is crossed over beneath her huge breasts. Dual streams of water are being expelled from her large, puffy nipples, which fall down into the pool beneath her with a gentle splashing sound.
	</p>
	<p>
		A bronze plaque attached to the plinth upon which this statue stands reads: 'Funds for the creation and installation of this fountain were donated by the residents of Elis. Long may Minotallys guide us to prosperity!'

		Over in one of the far corners of the shopping precinct, a sign hanging from the upper floor of a timber-framed building shows a stylised pair of sheep-girls holding up the words 'Woolly Heaven'. Blinds have been half-closed over most of the windows on the ground floor, and the spots which aren't concealed in this manner are home to shelves stacked full of potted plants, making it all but impossible to see into the building's interior. Thankfully for potential customers, the nature of this business is revealed from the writing that's etched into the glass of its front door. [pc.Stepping] forwards to take a closer look, you read: 'Woolly Heaven: Massage Parlour, Hair & Nail Salon, Jewellers'

	<htmlContent tag="TOILETS"><![CDATA[

		Wherever there's a concentration of members of the public, there exists the need for offering restroom facilities. Wall's End is no exception to this, and has met this need by converting the ground floor of one of the timber-framed buildings into public toilets.
	</p>
	<p>
		A sign next to the entrance informs you that these facilities are open 24/7 and are cleaned at least once per hour, in addition to asking members of the public to please treat the toilets with respect. An additional sign has been attached beneath this one at what you assume to be a later date, and reminds the reader that the creation of glory holes in the stalls is considered to be vandalism, and is punishable by a fine of up to one hundred flames.
