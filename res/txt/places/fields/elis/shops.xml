		Congratulating the cow-girl on her success, you ask her if business has always been this good. Nodding her head, Monica explains, [monica.speech(Before I bought it and turned it into 'The Fashionable Moo', this place used to be a different clothing store, and so everyone in Elis already knew to come here for their clothing.

		Wanting to do things a little differently, you tell Monica that it would be best for her to operate the pump while you massage her breasts. Flashing you a sly smile as she hears what it is you want to do, the cow-girl pushes out her chest and teases, [monica.speech(You want to get a good feel of my tits? Come on then...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With Monica agreeing to your suggestion, you move into position beside her, and as she places her pump's suction cup over one her massive nipples, you reach forwards and sink your [pc.fingers+] into her huge, pillowy mammaries. The cow-girl lets out a deeply erotic moan as you start to grope and massage her breasts, and as she operates her breast pump to extract the milk from her dark nipples, she pants, [monica.speech(~Ooh!~ Yes, that feels so good... ~Mmm!~ That's it, [pc.name]!

		Wanting to do more than simply operate Monica's breast pump, you tell her that it would be more effective for you to use your mouth and suckle on her breasts instead. The cow-girl's cheeks flush red as she hears you say this, but after flashing you a coy smile, she agrees to your plan by teasing, [monica.speech(You want me to breast-feed you? Well, if that's what you really want, [pc.name], then I'm happy to play along...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Pushing out her chest, Monica beckons you forwards, and as you move your face towards her massive breasts, she reaches forwards and pulls you into her huge, pillowy mammaries. After planting a series of kisses on her massive breasts, you quickly move over to one of her large, dark nipples, before parting your [pc.lips+] and taking it into your mouth. Using your [pc.tongue+] to playfully lick and tease her teat, you start to suck on Monica's nipple, and within a second, her warm, creamy milk starts to seep out into your mouth. The cow-girl lets out a deeply erotic moan as you start to suckle on her breast, and as she pulls your face into her chest, she pants, [monica.speech(~Ooh!~ Yes, that feels so good... ~Mmm!~ That's it, [pc.name]! Keep going...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The cow-girl starts letting out a stream of horny moans and sighs under her breath as you continue to suck on her nipple and drink her milk. After several minutes, she gently pushes you back and asks you to switch to her other breast, and as you follow Monica's instructions and move over to start sucking on her other teat, she rubs her legs together and pants, [monica.speech(You're so good at this, [pc.name]... ~Mmm!~ Yes... Drink it all down, that's a good [pc.girl]...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After spending the next five or so minutes drinking Monica's milk, you start to feel quite full, and after pulling back from her huge breasts, you ask her how much more milking she needs. Letting out a playful laugh, she tells you that her tits are still well over half full, and so with there being simply too much milk to be drunk in a single session, you end up having to use the cow-girl's breast pump after all. Placing the pump's suction cup over one of Monica's massive nipples, you start to operate the device's lever, and thanks to its transparent plastic construction, you're able to see a steady stream of milk start to ooze out of the cow-girl's teat as the pump's vacuum does its work. Placing her hands down on the bed behind her, she pushes out her chest and lets out another deeply erotic moan, before panting, [monica.speech(~Mmm!~ Yes, that feels so good... ~Aah!~ Keep going, [pc.name]...)]

		Soon enough, the bottle that's attached to the pump is completely full of milk, but instead of signalling the end of the milking session, Monica produces another empty bottle from out of her cabinet, and after swapping them over, she asks you to keep going. Twenty minutes, and a lot of horny moaning and panting later, and several bottles full of Monica's milk are sitting on the floor beside you. With her breasts now drained, the cow-girl lets out a deep, satisfied moan, before happily smiling at you and sighing, [monica.speech(That was amazing, thank you so much for helping me with this, [pc.name]...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she says your name, she spreads her legs a little, and as your attention is drawn down to her groin, you see that there's a wet patch in her lacy panties. Letting out a little high-pitched laugh as she sees you looking down between her legs, she teases, [monica.speech(You know, cows are conditioned to associate being milked with having sex... You've really got me turned on now, so how about it? Want to have some fun before I have to get back to work?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Dropping one of her hands down to her groin, Monica slides her panties to one side, flashing you her dripping-wet pussy as she lets out an excited moan. Her [monica.labiaSize] labia are the same dark shade as her nipples, and as you watch the cow-girl slide her fingers over her eager cunt, you wonder whether you should take things further and have sex with her right here and now...

		Although you enjoyed helping to milk Monica, you really don't feel like having sex with her, and so you tell the cow-girl that you've got to leave. She lets out a disappointed whine as she hears this, and after pouting at you, she sighs, [monica.speech(Fine... I'm going to need a few minutes to finish myself off here, so you can head downstairs and let yourself out. Thanks for helping me with my milking, [pc.name], and maybe next time you'll be up for a quick fuck?)]

		Making a non-committal response, you say goodbye to Monica, before [pc.stepping] out of her room and leaving her to deal with her arousal by herself.

Leaning into you, the horny cow-girl lets out an erotic moan and reveals in breathless sighs, [monica.speech(I don't normally get this bad... It must be because you're so good at milking...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Leaning heavily into you, Monica plants a big, wet kiss on your [pc.lips], and before you know it, the two of you are passionately making out with one another. After a few moments of this, the cow-girl breaks off from your kiss, before lying back on her bed and spreading her legs, and as she presents you with her wet cunt, she desperately moans, [monica.speech(Come on, [pc.name], fuck me already!)]

			<b>Wall's End</b>
			<br/>
			Standard Opening Times: [units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)]
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>History</b>
			<br/>
			How did this shopping precinct come into being? Why is it called 'Wall's End'? And why is it needed when the farmer's market already exists? Woah, so many questions! Thankfully, all three can be answered by recounting a little of our wonderful town's history!
			<br/><br/>
			As you might already know, in the past our town was just a village, although a village that was destined to grow into the best town in all of Lilith's Realm. Of course, as with any growing population, Elis soon had need of commercial premises which couldn't be accommodated by simple market stalls. As such, our wonderful mayor, Minotallys, decreed that a shopping precinct needed to be created.
			<br/><br/>
			This decision coincided with the most ambitious construction project Elis has ever seen. Known to the locals as 'the northern expansion', a portion of the defensive walls needed to be torn down and rebuilt so as to accommodate an entirely new district. Where you're standing right now is where that northern wall once stood, hence it was agreed that this shopping precinct should honour that history by being called 'Wall's End'!
			<br/><br/>
			I hope that answers your questions, and now you can get to shopping! Make sure to spend lots of money to help keep our economy ticking!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			<b>Businesses</b>
			<br/>
			Here at Wall's End we've got a convenience store, a place for clothes shopping, and even a massage parlour! Who needs to go to Dominion when you've got everything you could ever need right here?!
			<br/><br/>
			Most businesses are open six days a week, between [units.time(9)]-[units.time(17)]. The convenience store is open 24/7, however, so even if it's the middle of the night there's no reason for you not to come in and take a look around!

		In the very middle of Wall's End, facing the entrance, there's a large statue of the town's mayor, Minotallys. Expertly carved from white marble, this depiction of the town's favourite minotauress is wearing nothing except the jewellery which adorns her horns, fingers, and tail.

		With a playful grin on her face, this marble mimicry of Minotallys is using one hand to cover her pussy, while her other arm is crossed over beneath her huge breasts. Dual streams of water are being expelled from her large, puffy nipples, which fall down into the pool beneath her with a gentle splashing sound.
	</p>
