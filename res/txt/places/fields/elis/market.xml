			#ELSE

					Although there are many stalls throughout the Farmer's Market which offer clothing for sale, the one before you is by far the largest and most colourful. Consisting of a long counter covered by a rainbow-coloured, canvas awning, the stall before you is packed full of clothing of all sorts and colours. Looking up, you see that the wooden sign that's attached to the canvas awning displays this stall's name as 'Rainbow's End'. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking over the counter, you see that the stall's owners are a pair of orange-furred greater foxtauresses, who each look to be in their early thirties. While both of them stand at [fae.heightValue] and have remarkably similar facial appearances, one of them has bright blue eyes, while the other's are a mossy shade of green.
				</p>
				<p>
					The green-eyed foxtauress has a head of long, dark brown hair, that's been highlighted with streaks of red dye and tied back into a pony tail by means of a red-and-black scrunchie. She's wearing a black leather jacket, which is unzipped to reveal a dark red crop top, the fabric of which is tightly hugging her [fae.cupSize]-cup breasts. Aside from those three items of clothing, she's wearing nothing else except a significant amount of gold jewellery. Rings in her ears and nose, as well as a gemstone barbell in her navel, are joined by a necklace, a wrist bangle, and an anklet around one of her paws, all in gold. There are even the unmistakable bumps of a pair of nipple barbells pressing out from under her tight crop top.
				</p>
				<p>
					The blue-eyed foxtauress has hair of a similar length and dark brown shade as her companion, although hers is woven into a braid and dyed with streaks of pink instead of red. She's wearing the same kind of stylish leather jacket as the green-eyed foxtauress, although hers is brown, and instead of a red crop top she's wearing an equally tight-fitting white tube top. The fabric of this top is similarly stretched out by a pair of nipple piercings, although instead of barbells, hers look to be rings. She's wearing a similar amount and style of jewellery as her companion, although instead of gold hers is all silver.
				</p>
				<p>
					As they see you stop and look at their stall, these foxtauresses exchange a cheeky glance and smirk with one another. Before you can react, they quickly turn around on the spot and flick their huge, fluffy tails aside, shamelessly flashing you their animalistic fox-pussies and assholes. Even without any kind of stimulation, each of their cunts looks to be wet and begging to be fucked. Continuing to look down, you see that these foxtauresses both have a complete set of male genitalia in addition to their female sexes, and from the considerable size of their furry sheaths, you can tell that their cocks must be quite large when erect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Turning her head back to smile at you, the green-eyed foxtauress winks and teases, [fae.speech(See anything you like, hun? I haven't seen you around before, and my sister and I like to give first timers a bit of a treat... So come on, what do we call you?)]

		Not wanting to miss this opportunity, you tell the foxtauresses that you want to kiss them. Their faces light up as they hear you say this, and Fae and Siliva quickly step forwards and lean over the counter in anticipation of what's about to happen. Batting her eyelids, Fae teases, [fae.speech(Come on, [pc.name]. I'll be your first...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Moving forwards, you lean in towards Fae, and as you bring your mouth towards hers, she reaches forwards and takes hold of your head, before pulling you in and planting a big, wet kiss on your [pc.lips+]. The scent of delicate perfume surrounds you as the horny foxtauress continues to press her lips against yours, and she lets out a muffled, happy little moan as she kisses you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[silvia.speech(Come on, Fae, it's my turn now!)] Silvia impatiently declares, before playfully pushing her sister aside. Fae's lips pull away from yours with a loud, wet smacking noise, and before you can do or say anything, Silvia leans forwards and presses her own lips against your mouth. Happily leaning in to you, the blue-eyed foxtauress continues where her sister left off, and plants a series of big, wet kisses on your [pc.lips].
	</p>
	<p>
		Just as you're really starting to enjoy the experience, Silvia pulls back and sighs, [silvia.speech(You're a good kisser, [pc.name]...)] 
	</p>
	<p>
		With more than a hint of jealousy in her voice, Fae declares, [fae.speech(Well, <i>my</i> kiss was better than yours, Silvia.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With the two foxtauresses continuing to lean forwards over the counter, and with their eyes continuing to hungrily roam over your body, you wonder whether to take things further or to end things here...

I'm sure you'd like to win another kiss from the two of us, right?)]
	</p>

		Not yet satisfied, you lean back over towards Fae and once again press your [pc.lips+] against her mouth, before taking hold of her head and starting to passionately kiss her. Her bushy fox-tail excitedly twists around behind her, and with a happy, muffled moan, she desperately returns your kiss. Parting her lips, the foxtauress thrusts her tongue into your mouth and leans even further forwards over her counter in her desperation to make out with you. As her tongue slides over yours, you feel that she's got a barbell piercing through it, and as you experimentally run your tongue over it, she lets out a muffled giggle.
	</p>
	<p>
		After watching your lewd display for a couple of minutes, Silvia lets out a loud, frustrated sigh, before rudely butting in and pushing her sister away. Before either of you can react, the blue-eyed foxtauress impatiently grabs hold of your head and desperately presses her mouth against yours. Happy to give Silvia a turn, you spend another few minutes making out with her, during which time you discover that she too has a barbell piercing through her tongue. Eventually, at the incessant prompting of her sister, Silvia reluctantly pulls back, bringing an end to your fun.
	</p>
	<p>
		[fae.speech(We don't get customers like you very often...)] Fae whines, before flashing Siliva a questioning glance. After her sister has given her an approving nod, the green-eyed foxtauress looks back at you and says, [fae.speech(The two of us go to 'The Centaur's Sword' every evening after work. If you want more than just a kiss, then you can find us in there between seven and ten...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[silvia.speech(I hope we'll see you in there soon,)] Silvia says, before letting out a playful giggle and asking, [silvia.speech(Did you want to buy anything, [pc.name]? Or if you've got another ticket, then maybe you could roll to earn another kiss...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With the two foxtauresses waiting to hear what your response will be, you wonder whether to do as Silvia suggests, or instead say goodbye and take your leave...

					In stark contrast to the colourful canvas seen throughout most of the Farmer's Market, the awning which covers the stall in front of you is a dark shade of purple. The counter upon which dozens of sex toys are on display is draped in a black cloth, which combined with the dark purple curtains that hang from three of the stall's four sides, gives this business a very ominous appearance. Thick strands of white spider webbing have not only been spun into webs in each of the corners of this stall, but have also have been skilfully woven into the words 'Yui's Toys'.
				</p>
				<p>
					You almost don't notice this stall's unusual décor, as your attention is immediately drawn to the demonic spider-girl who's standing behind the counter. Although she's standing at a relatively small [yui.heightValue], this [yui.race] gives off an incredibly threatening vibe. It's not the striking, black-and-yellow stripes of her chitinous skin that sends a shudder down your spine, nor the jet-black leather fetish gear that she's wearing, nor even the fact that she's got six arms that are all quickly moving as they play with strands of thin spider webbing shot out of the spinneret at the end of her bulbous, spider-like tail. What really makes you stop dead in your tracks is the fact that this spider-girl has eight glowing-crimson eyes spread across her upper face, each one of which is gazing at you with a look of petrifying malice.

					[yui.speech(Don't you know that it's rude to stare?)] she asks, her voice dripping with patronising amusement. Using one of her six arms to tuck a loose strand of her black-and-red head back into her bun, this small spider-girl leans forwards over her counter and beckons you forwards. With a thin smirk on her pretty face, she demands, [yui.speech(So go on then, tell me who you are.)]

Sadistically grinning at you as she watches you struggle, Yui pulls on a strand of webbing with two of her six arms, which causes you to tumble down to the floor. Dropping down and using her many limbs to reposition you into a kneeling pose, the small [yui.race] grabs a small, padded seat from under her counter and sits down on it. Kicking off her heavy, gothic boots to reveal her latex stockings, she lifts her feet and places them down onto your still-exposed [pc.hands].

		[yui.speech(Be a good toy for me, and I'll let you taste my bare feet later,)] she sneers, before sadistically pushing her stocking-clad feet down against your [pc.hands]. Swiping her riding crop down to slap your side, she orders, [yui.speech(Now get started, toy. Massage my feet.)]

Turned on at the thought of being able to worship these delicate, feminine feet, you do your best to lean forwards and kiss them.

Reaching under the counter, Yui produces a Faire ticket, and as she hands it to you, she says, [yui.speech(There you go, toy.

		Wanting Yui to demonstrate how to use a ballgag, you give her one of your Faire tickets and make your request. Narrowing her eight, glowing-crimson eyes, a sadistic smirk settles on the demonic spider-girl's face, and with a swift crack of her riding crop, she orders, [yui.speech(Come around to my side of the counter, toy.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Doing as you're told, you [pc.step] around to the other side of the stall's counter. Reaching back to the spinneret at the tip of her large, spider-like tail, Yui starts to pull out a long, sticky silken thread. Without any warning, she starts patting this sticky thread onto your body, before grabbing hold of you and spinning you around. Before you know what's happening, Yui's tightly wrapped you up in a cocoon, and after pulling on a couple of threads, she lifts you into the air so that your [pc.ass+] is pointing towards teh open side of the stall.
	</p>
	<p>
		[yui.speech(That's a good toy,)] she sneers as she steps around in front of you. Holding up a hot-pink ball gag, she places four of her arms down on her hips and explains in a mock-patronising voice, [yui.speech(Ball gags are very useful for keeping toys quiet. Open wide, so that I can demonstrate this to you.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Having specifically asked for this, you're more than willing to obey Yui's command. Opening your mouth, you stay still as the demonic spider-girl fastens the ball gag into place. Stepping around behind you, Yui lifts her riding crop and uses it to deliver a sharp smack to your rear end. Your surprised cry is almost completely muffled by the gag that's now in your mouth, and as she hears that it's working, Yui teases, [yui.speech(See? You're almost completely unable to make any protests while wearing that. Now be a good toy and raise your ass so that I can give you a good public whipping and further demonstrate the gag's effectiveness.)]

Exhaling another cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates into the air, he reveals, [kazik.speech(I love knocking hot babes like you up... Anyway, what're you here for?

					The owner of this stall is standing behind the counter with his arms crossed, and takes the form of a strikingly-handsome greater ferret-boy. Sporting a black leather jacket, navy-blue jeans, and a pair of aviators, he looks like some kind of biker, although as motor vehicles don't exist in this reality, his fashion sense must have come from somewhere else. Tapping a cigarette out of an already opened pack, he lights it up and takes a deep drag, before slowly exhaling and casting his [kazik.eyeColour] eyes over in your direction.

		Flashing Kazik a sly grin, you tell him that he already knows which one you want him to cast. Shaking his head, he warns,
		#IF(pc.isFeminine())
			 [kazik.speech(Look, if you really want me to cast arcane arousal on you, then I can't be held responsible for what happens afterwards. If you get horny, then you're going to make me horny, and then I think we can all guess where that will end.)]
		#ELSE
			 [kazik.speech(Look, if you really want me to cast arcane arousal on you, then I can't be held responsible for what happens afterwards. If you get horny, then you're going to make me feel pretty uncomfortable; I'm only into girls, so I'm not doing anything sexual with you.)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling Kazik to get on with it already, you gesture for him to hit you with the spell. Letting out a defeated sigh, the handsome ferret-boy reluctantly does as you ask, and after making a wide, sweeping gesture with both hands, he starts to summon forth a few wisps of bright pink arcane energy around his arms. Focusing all of his power into the spell, Kazik unleashes the arousing force, and you watch as the pink energy shoots up into your head. Instantly, you feel that your receptivity to the spell has magnified its power, and you're presented with extremely graphic, vivid images of
		#IF(pc.getSexualOrientation().isAttractedToMasculine())
			 Kazik fucking you
		#ELSE
			 hot girls having sex with you
		#ENDIF
		 right here in the middle of the Farmer's Market.

		[kazik.speech(Hey! Are you ok?)] Kazik shouts, snapping you out of your arcane-induced daydream. Letting out an extremely horny [pc.moan] in response, you tell the ferret-boy that you need a good hard fuck.
	</p>
	<p>
		[kazik.speech(See? I told you this would happen,)] he replies with a sigh.
		#IF(pc.isFeminine())
			 As you let out another lewd squeal and tell him that you're getting absolutely desperate for sex, the ferret-boy starts getting visibly agitated, and he lowers his voice to offer, [kazik.speech(I can help you out, I guess. You like cock? All your moaning's got me hard...)]
		#ELSE
			 As you let out another lewd squeal and tell him that you're getting absolutely desperate for sex, the ferret-boy shakes his head and says, [kazik.speech(I'm not interested in helping you out. I've demonstrated the spell for you, now deal with the consequences.)]

		Duly impressed by Kazik's proficiency with the arcane, you tell him that his spell was a sight to behold.

I was even able to achieve higher grades than some demons!)]
	</p>

		After you've made another comment about how fantastic his spell was, Kazik crosses his arms and asks, [kazik.speech(So, now that the show's over, did you want to buy something, [pc.name]?)]

I was even able to achieve higher grades than some demons!)]

		After you've made another dismissive comment about how disappointing his spell was, Kazik crosses his arms and huffs, [kazik.speech(Whatever. Everyone else liked it... So did you want to buy something, or just keep on insulting me?)]

		With Kazik unwilling to offer you a hand in dealing with your intense arousal, you do your best to focus on anything but sex and try to calm your overwhelming libido. At first it seems like nothing is going to work, and it's only as you're just on the verge of breaking down and masturbating right here in public when you finally feel yourself starting to regain control. A few deep breaths and a moment spent in silence later, and you feel your lust starting to fade away.

		Hearing Kazik say that he's got an erection from all your moaning only turns you on even more, and after [pc.stepping] right up to his counter, you lick your lips and tell the handsome ferret-boy that you could do with his cock in your mouth right about now. Looking down over the table, you tell him to get his cock out and let you see what you'll be sucking in a moment.
	</p>
	<p>
		[kazik.speech(I shouldn't be doing this...)] he muses, but despite his words, he unzips his jeans and unbuttons his boxers, before taking out his rapidly-hardening cock and showing it to you. Biting your lip and letting out a hungry moan, you look down to see that his [kazik.cockColour], [kazik.cockGirth] shaft is [kazik.cockLengthValue] long, and there's already a bead of slimy precum starting to ooze out of the tip.
	</p>
	<p>
		The intense effect of Kazik's spell, combined with the sight of his hardening cock, is far too much for you to resist, and you desperately demand that the ferret-boy lets you give him a blowjob.

Swinging and locking a long, glass cover shut over his goods, the ferret-boy steps around to join you in the hidden alcove, before taking hold of his hard cock and saying, [kazik.speech(Get to it then.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Dropping down in front of the handsome ferret-boy, you open your mouth and deliver a big, wet kiss to the [kazik.cockHead+] of his throbbing shaft. Darting out your [pc.tongue+], you happily lick up his salty precum, which causes him to let out a deep groan and grunt, [kazik.speech(Stop teasing... Just get to it already...)]

		Letting out a little giggle, you press your mouth against his cock and give it a loud, wet kiss. Parting your [pc.lips+], you take his [kazik.cockHead] into your mouth with the intention of teasing him a little longer, but Kazik impatiently takes hold of your head and pulls you forwards, sliding his hard, hot shaft down your throat and grunting, [kazik.speech(Yes... That's it...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Letting out a muffled, spluttering moan, you decide to forgo any more foreplay and start bobbing your head up and down as you happily give the handsome ferret-boy a blowjob...
