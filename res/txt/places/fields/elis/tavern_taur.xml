	<p>
		A huge, circular bar is positioned right in the very centre of the tavern, and it's from here that drinks are served to the tauric client√®le. So as to accommodate the taurs who frequent this establishment, the bar's wooden counter is quite tall, and there's not a single bar stool to be seen anywhere around its circumference.
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF((game.getHourOfDay()>=15 && game.getHourOfDay()<=23))
			As it's currently the busy time of day, there's almost no space at all at the bar. Well over a dozen taurs of all kinds are either standing or sitting around the counter, and as you approach you hear them either ordering drinks or flirting and talking with one another.
		#ELSE
			As it's currently the quiet time of day, there's plenty of space at the bar. Only a couple of taurs are standing at the counter, and as you approach you hear them talking with one another.

				[pc.Stepping] up to the bar, you see Kheiron himself trot around from behind the bar's central pillar, and as he catches sight of you, he flashes you a smile and asks, [kheiron.speech(What can I get for you today, [pc.name]?)]
			#ELSE
					[pc.Stepping] up to the bar, you see a huge, olive-skinned centaur, who looks to be in his mid-forties, trot around from behind the bar's central pillar. His muscular, lower horse's body is covered in dark brown hair, which is a similar shade to the short, curly hair on his head. Thanks to the fact that he's only wearing a short-sleeved shirt, you're able to see that his exposed horse-cock and balls are absolutely massive. Just like his horse-half, this centaur's human body is extremely muscular, which, combined with the fact that he's standing at no less than [kheiron.heightValue], leaves you with no doubt that he must be one of the strongest people in all of Elis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Glancing around the bar, this centaur's hazel eyes catch yours, and after flashing you a handsome smile, he steps forwards and speaks in a low, booming voice, [kheiron.speech(I haven't seen you here before. First time in Elis, or is this just your first time visiting my tavern?)]
			#ENDIF
		#ELSE
			[pc.Stepping] up to the bar, you see that Kheiron isn't here at the moment, and instead there's a large, muscular centauress working behind the counter. Catching sight of you, she steps forwards and asks, [style.feminineSpeech(Hey there, can I get you something?)]

	<p>
		Seeing no reason not to introduce yourself to this friendly centaur, you tell him your name and
		#IF(pc.isQuestProgressLessThan(QUEST_LINE_MAIN, QUEST_MAIN_3_C_MEETING_MINOTALLYS))
			 confirm that this is indeed your first time here in Elis.
		#ELSE
			 explain that you've already spent some time in Elis, but that you're not a native to the town.
		#ENDIF
		 Nodding as he listens, this centaur responds, [kheiron.speech(It's good to meet you, [pc.name]. My name's Kheiron, and I'm the owner of this tavern. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. Oh, and you say that you're not from Elis? Did you come from Dominion, by any chance?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After you've confirmed to Kheiron that you have indeed come from the Realm's capital city, the centaur steps right up to the counter and leans in to ask, [kheiron.speech(Did you see a couple of centaurs offering transport out there? They're called Astrapi and Vronti. Know them?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF(flags.hasFlag(FLAG_innoxia_centaur_transport_introduced))
			Having met the centaurs he's asking about, you tell Kheiron that you do know who he's talking about, and that they've recently set up a transportation service between Elis and Dominion. Letting out a relieved sigh, Kheiron steps back and explains, [kheiron.speech(I'm their father, you see. They're not very good at keeping in touch, and as we don't get many visitors from Dominion these days I don't often hear if they're still doing ok out there.)]
		#ELSE
			Having not met the centaurs he's asking about, you tell Kheiron that you don't know who he's talking about. Letting out a sigh, Kheiron steps back and explains, [kheiron.speech(I'm their father, you see. They're not very good at keeping in touch, and as we don't get many visitors from Dominion these days I don't often hear if they're still doing ok out there. I guess I'll have to head out and check on them myself some time this week.)]
		#ENDIF

	<p>
		#IF(game.isHourBetween(8, 24))
			With several customers waiting nearby to be served, Kheiron smiles at you and asks, [kheiron.speech(So, can I get you a drink, [pc.name]?)]
		#ELSE
			With your brief talk now over, Kheiron smiles at you and reveals, [kheiron.speech(I'm normally in bed at this hour, but I had to come downstairs to get a leaky beer tap fixed. Anyway, can I get you a drink before I head off, [pc.name]?)]

	<p>
		Wanting to make some small talk and get to know Kheiron a little better, you ask him how his day has been going so far.
		#IF(game.isHourBetween(8, 24))
			 Despite the fact that there are many customers waiting to be served, the centaur leaves business to his other employees and chooses to engage you in conversation, and replies, 
		#ELSE
			 As there's nobody at the bar who requires his attention, the centaur chooses to engage you in conversation, and replies, 
		#ENDIF
		 [kheiron.speech(Everything's going well, today, [pc.name]. Thanks for asking. How about yourself?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Happy to continue talking with him, you respond to Kheiron's question and then continue to engage him in conversation. Talking about everything from the weather to recent events in Elis, the two of you spend the next fifteen minutes talking with one another over the bar's counter. Eventually, however, the muscular centaur declares, [kheiron.speech(It's been good talking with you, [pc.name], but I've got things to be getting on with. Is there anything else I can do for you?)]

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_LUNETTE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Wanting to hear what Kheiron thinks about Lunette, you ask him what he knows of the elder lilin. His eyes narrow a little as he hears your question, and after spending a moment in thought, he replies, [kheiron.speech(Best not to be mentioning that name too loudly in here. You'll not find one person in all of Elis who has a good word to say about Lunette, but taurs can get particularly angry when they start speaking about her.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Wanting to know more, you ask the muscular centaur why that's the case, to which he sighs and replies, [kheiron.speech(Lunette's daughters seem to have a particular fondness for taurs. Many of the folk in here used to live out in the fields, and so have been the target of those demonic centaurs' affections, whether they wanted it or not. Let's just leave it at that, ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As Kheiron is clearly unwilling to say any more about the subject, you decide to move on to something else..

	<htmlContent tag="BAR_TALK_HISTORY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Curious about Kheiron's history, you ask him about his past and how he came to own this tavern. After taking a moment to think about where to start, he begins, [kheiron.speech(There's not really much to tell about most of my life. I used to live out in the woods with a group of other centaurs, but we ended up going our separate ways after Lunette's raiders started taking an interest in us. That was well before they started really getting out of control, but even all those years ago Lunette's daughters were a real pain to deal with.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		After taking a moment to think, the muscular centaur continues, [kheiron.speech(Everyone else ended up going to Dominion, but I stuck around here in Elis. To cut a long story short, after many years doing all sorts of jobs here in Elis I ended up being given the opportunity to buy this tavern. It was on the verge of being shut down and demolished when I took over, but by converting it into a place that caters for taurs, I managed to turn its fortunes around.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Wanting to know a little more about his past, you ask Kheiron whether his son and daughter used to work with him here in Elis, to which he replies, [kheiron.speech(Oh, no. Astrapi and Vronti had no interest in staying in Elis. They went off to Dominion to try and make their own way there. I keep on telling them that they can come and work here with me, but they have no interest.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Having had enough of recounting his past, the muscular centaur quickly follows up on his last sentence by asking, [kheiron.speech(Anyway, can I get you a drink, [pc.name]?)]

Their orange fur is exceptionally smooth and luxurious, and you can't help but smile every time you touch their white tips and cause the sisters to let out an excited little laugh in response. Eventually, however, all three of you get tired of this game, and so Fae and Silvia turn back around and lean into you.

		Wanting to get on with it, you lean over towards Fae and press your [pc.lips+] against her mouth, before giving her a big, wet kiss. Instantly, she responds by desperately clambering forwards into your lap, pressing her lips firmly against yours and forcing her tongue into your mouth. Grinding up against you, she starts letting out a series of high-pitched, muffled whines, and after spending a moment passionately making out with you, she pulls back and breathlessly pants, [fae.speech(Oh yeah... That's what I've been wanting...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not one to sit back and miss out on the fun, Silvia reaches up and grabs your head, before pulling your face towards hers and desperately pressing her lips against yours. Just like her sister, the horny foxtauress forces her pierced tongue into your mouth, and after pushing her sister back, she takes Fae's place in your lap and starts wildly grinding up against you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[fae.speech(That's not fair. I want another go,)] Fae complains, before moving forwards and jostling against her sister for the prime position on your lap. With the two foxtauresses fighting over your mouth, you find yourself suddenly switching between making out with Silvia, then Fae, then Silvia again. After ten minutes of this awkward, passionate make out session, the two sisters call a truce, and both look down at you with a hungry gleam in their green and blue eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		[fae.speech(Come on, [pc.name],)] Fae whines.
	</p>
	<p>
		[silvia.speech(Let's go somewhere where we can fuck,)] Silvia finishes.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the two sisters clearly desperate for sex, you wonder whether or not to invite them back to your room at 'The Red Dragon'...

		Wanting to do more than just kiss these horny sisters, you ask Fae and Silvia if they'd like to accompany you back to your room in 'The Red Dragon'.

		With the two of them telling you all sorts of lewd things they'd like to do with you tonight, you lead Fae and Silvia down the street to 'The Red Dragon', and after heading through the building and up the stairs, you soon find yourself at the door to your room. After waiting for you to unlock the door, the sisters step inside, after which Fae turns to face you and moan, [fae.speech(I've been looking forward to this...)]
