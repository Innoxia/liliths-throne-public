	<htmlContent tag="CORRIDOR"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The corridor which you find yourself travelling down connects all of the rooms of the tavern's first floor. Pictures similar to the ones found downstairs line the walls, and invariably portray some form of idyllic pastoral scene. The wall-mounted arcane lamps cast this area in a pale yellow glow, and you end up making the old, wooden floorboards creak as you [pc.walk] over them on your way forwards...

	<htmlContent tag="ROOM_GENERIC"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The old wooden door before you leads into one of the many rooms which are rented out to lodgers, and is currently firmly shut. A sign slotted into a brass bracket displays the word 'Occupied', and you think you can hear the sounds of someone moving around within.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you have no business with the room's occupant, there's little else for you to do except turn around and continue on your way down the corridor...

	<htmlContent tag="ROOM_MERAXIS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Even if you didn't already know that the door before you leads to Meraxis's room, you could very easily deduce it from the words on the metal sign that's been nailed into its surface.
		#IF(pc.hasTraitActivated(PERK_CHUUNI))
			 Smiling to yourself as you see her impressive title, you read:
		#ELSE
			 Letting out a despairing sigh as you see her ridiculous title, you read:
		#ENDIF
		 'This is the lair of The Dark Siren! Only the brave or foolish dare to disturb my slumber! Mwhahaha!'
	</p>
	<p>
		Wondering whether she dictated the words of this sign to someone else, or actually wrote herself laughing at the bottom, you listen for any sound of movement coming from inside
		#IF(game.getCharactersPresent().contains(meraxis))
			 and hear the chuuni [meraxis.race] loudly snoring. As she previously told you not to disturb her sleep unless there's an emergency, you decide that it's best to turn around and head back the way you came...
		#ELSE
			 but don't hear a thing. If you wanted to speak with Meraxis, it looks like you'll have to head back the way you came and search for her at her usual spot downstairs...

	<htmlContent tag="ROOM_PLAYER"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		While not as large as the one back in Lilaya's mansion, your room here in The Red Dragon is nevertheless impressively spacious. Although it houses a double-size bed, a smart wardrobe and dresser, and a couple of comfortable chairs, there's plenty of space left over for you to [pc.walk] around in. Doing just that, you [pc.step] forwards over the dark wooden floorboards and onto the rug that's positioned at the end of your bed. Looking around at the cream-coloured walls and dark wooden beams that hold up the high ceiling, you find yourself thinking that although it's smaller than the one you've become accustomed to in Dominion, your room here has a very relaxing, cosy feel to it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Heading over to the far side of the room, you're able to look out of the leaded, bay windows and see a good portion of the streets of Elis down below.
		#IF(game.isDayTime())
			 Thanks to the time of day, there are quite a lot of people out and about, and you spend a minute or two simply watching the residents of this town travelling about on their business.
		#ELSE
			 Thanks to the time of night, the arcane street lamps are all turned on and casting a pale yellow light over the quiet road.
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning back to face your room, you look over at the door to your ensuite. Having been left open, you're able to look inside and see not only your porcelain bath and shower, but also your arcane-powered washing machine. The promotional sticker has been left on the side of this machine, and promises to remove all stains and have even the dirtiest items of clothing dry and ready to wear in under ten minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Letting out a relaxed sigh, you wonder whether to spend some time resting in here, or perhaps to make use of the washing facilities available to you...

	<htmlContent tag="ROOM_PLAYER_REST"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Feeling a little worn down and tired from all of your recent activities, you draw your curtains before collapsing down onto your bed and setting your phone's alarm. Closing your eyes, you then let out a deep sigh, and with the feeling of being safe and comfortable here in The Red Dragon, you soon drift off to sleep, thinking about all the things that have happened to you recently...
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Beep-beep... beep-beep... bee-</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Rolling over, you fumble for your phone, turning off the alarm before sinking back onto your bed with a sigh. As comfortable as you are, you decide that you'd better get out of bed, and so after a minute of lying beneath the covers, you do just that. Opening the curtains, you set about gathering your things, and then with one final stretch, you get ready to set out once more...

		Wanting to clean yourself, but not spend too much time doing so, you [pc.step] into your ensuite bathroom and decide upon taking a quick shower. Disrobing, you put your clothing into the arcane washing machine, before stepping over to your basic-yet-functional shower.
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning on the tap, you let out a relaxed sigh as you feel the warm water flowing down over your naked body. Not wanting to spend too much time in the shower, you focus on quickly cleaning yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a short while spent cleaning your body under the flowing water, you feel as though you've spent enough time in the shower, and so turn off the tap and dry yourself with a fluffy towel. Retrieving your now-clean clothing from the arcane washing machine, you get dressed and [pc.step] back into your room...

		The wooden door before you is tightly shut, and hanging from a nail hammered into its surface, there's a sign which reads: 'Flash's Room. Do not disturb unless in case of emergency.'

		As there's no emergency,

		You find yourself standing before the only door in the corridor that's not in its original state. Not only is it painted a light shade of pink, but someone, who you assume to be Jess, has used white paint to write in flowery, feminine handwriting on the surface: 'Jess's Room. Please do not disturb! See me downstairs if you want something! xxx'

			#IF(game.getNonCompanionCharactersPresent().size()>1)
				 The need for the door's tight seal is made clear as you spend a moment standing in front of it; Jess's high-pitched moaning and the creaking of her bed can be quite clearly be heard from through the keyhole, and if the door was as poorly-fitting as the others in the corridor, you imagine that none of the lodgers would be able to get any peace while Jess was working.
