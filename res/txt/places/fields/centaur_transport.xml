	<p>
		Having been previously interrupted by Meraxis, you decide to continue with your exploration of the 'Centaur Carriage Depot'. As you approach the two dilapidated barns which sit on opposite sides of the road, you can quite clearly see that the one on your right is completely unsuitable for housing any sort of business. Not only has half of the roof fallen in, but the large doors which open out onto the road have been smashed to pieces, allowing you to see that the interior is filled with broken old carts and ransacked crates, with a hazardous mix of smashed glass and splintered wood covering the entire floor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning your attention to the second of the two barns, you see that this structure is in a far better state of repair. Although its ivy-covered, wooden walls seem to be buckling in a couple of places, it doesn't seem to have suffered any critical structural damage, and what's more, the short strip of ground leading from the road to the barn's wide doors looks to have been very recently cleared of weeds and debris. Looking over this cleared ground to the doors themselves, you spot what's clearly a brand new wooden sign that's been nailed to one of them. Carved out and painted in large white letters, you read:
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:center;'><i>
		<b>Astrapi & Vronti Grigori</b>
		<br/>offering

	</i></p>
	#IF(game.isHourBetween(5.75, 15))
		<p>
			Even if this sign wasn't enough to inform you that there's at least one business still operating out of here, one of the barn doors have been left half-open, and from within you can hear a feminine voice occasionally calling out to someone. As the sign informs you that the business is currently [style.colourGood(open)], you could enter via this half-open door and see what's happening within...
		</p>
	#ELSE
		<p>
			From this sign you can quite clearly see that there's at least one business still operating out of here, although due to the time they're currently [style.colourBad(closed)]. If you wanted to meet with this 'Astrapi' or 'Vronti' then you should come back between [units.time(5.75)]-[units.time(15)]...

	<p>
		Deciding to wait until the barn opens, you loiter around in the nearby area until eventually it's [units.time(5.75)]. Looking over at the barn once again, you see that one of the doors have been half opened; whoever's responsible for doing this must have approached from the rear of the barn and entered via a back door, or else you would clearly have seen them coming down the road. As you head over to the barn from where you were waiting, you hear a feminine voice coming from within.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="APPROACH_INSIDE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		[pc.Walking] up to the barn's half-open door, you peer inside to see that most of the straw-strewn interior is empty. As you [pc.step] through the doorway and enter the barn, you take note of the fact that only about one quarter of the barn's available space is in use, and houses not only a pair of large, four-wheeled wooden carriages, but also a dozen crates and a couple of workshop benches. A large, muscular centaur and an equally-buff centauress are standing to the side of one of these carriages, both of whom have their backs to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not having seen you enter their barn, these two centaurs continue with what they're doing, which you see is changing the wheel on the carriage they're standing next to. In a display of incredible strength, the female centaur, who has [astrapi.legColour] horse hair, [astrapi.skinColour] skin, and wavy, [astrapi.hairColour]-coloured hair, grabs hold of the side of the carriage, and with a deep grunt, she lifts it up off the floor. The male, who has [vronti.legColour] horse hair and [vronti.skinColour] skin similar in shade to the female, then moves in to slide off the wheel they've clearly just loosened, before swiftly fitting a new one and allowing his companion to lower the cart.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(That's all of them, then,)] the centauress says, [astrapi.speech(so once you've secured that wheel I'll take this carriage over to Elis, while you go and tell that stuck-up bitch that we quit.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Simply letting out an agreeable grunt in response, the centaur turns to pick up his tools from the nearby workbench, and it's at this moment that you're finally spotted. Granting you a curt nod, the centaur looks over to his companion and utters, [vronti.speech(Customer.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(What, already?!)] the centauress replies, before turning to look over her shoulder at you. With this seeming to be as good a time as any, you decide to start things off by introducing yourself to the two centaurs...
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="INTRODUCTIONS"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Offering the pair a greeting, you introduce yourself as [pc.name], before asking if they're the 'Astrapi' and 'Vronti' whose names were on the sign outside.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(We sure are! I'm Astrapi, pleased to meet you, and this is my older brother, Vronti,)] the centauress cheerily responds as she turns to face you. As she does so, you see that she's not wearing any sort of top or bra, leaving her huge, [astrapi.cupSize]-cup breasts completely exposed to you. In fact, the only items of clothing which she appears to be wearing are a pair of blue-grey sweat bands around her wrists, and a similar-coloured one around her head. Her brother seems to share her fondness for a lack of clothing, for he doesn't seem to be wearing anything at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(You got here at the perfect time,)] Astrapi happily declares. Her huge breasts bounce up and down in time with her trotting as she then approaches you and continues, [astrapi.speech(My brother and I were planning on re-opening our carriage business starting tomorrow, but I was just about to take this one over to Elis, so you could choose to be our first customer right now, if you'd like. If not, then no big deal; we'll be doing trips to and from Elis at six and nine in the morning, another one at midday, and a final one at three in the afternoon, so you can always catch us then.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she flashes you a big smile, you find yourself noticing just how incredibly muscular this exhibitionist centauress is. Her clearly-defined six-pack and huge shoulder, arm, and neck muscles hint at a life spent performing physical labour. Although her huge breasts, feminine voice, and clear lack of male genitalia make it extremely obvious that she's a female, Astrapi's face has an androgynous quality to it, which, combined with her shoulder-length hair, impressive physique, and height of [astrapi.heightValue], gives her a very tomboyish appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		You find yourself thinking that her cheery personality and manner of speaking also fits into this categorisation, which is further reinforced as she looks over to her brother and calls out, [astrapi.speech(Come on, Vron, you know you've got to stop being so shy! You're gonna be alone with customers every day from now on. Try introducing yourself to [pc.name] here!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Letting out a deep sigh, Vronti finishes tightening the bolts on the wheel, before standing up and turning to face you and Astrapi. Slowly walking over to where the two of you are standing, he rolls his eyes and grunts in a deep, masculine voice, [vronti.speech(I'm Vronti... Hi.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(That's the spirit,)] Astrapi laughs, before playfully punching her brother on the arm and teasing, [astrapi.speech(Hey, Vronti, you're starting to blush!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Sure enough, the huge centaur, who stands just a little taller than his sister at [vronti.heightValue], seems to be blushing just a little. His stoic expression betrays no hint of embarrassment, however, and after enduring a little more teasing from his sister he simply turns around and walks back to the carriages. As he moves, you see that his muscles are even larger and more well-defined than his sister's, which combined with his incredible body mass makes him look absolutely titanic in comparison with a regular centaur.
	</p>
	<p>
		Turning her attention back to you, Astrapi asks, [astrapi.speech(So, are you gonna come with me on a trip to Elis? It's only two-hundred and fifty flames for a ticket! That's a real bargain, you know, especially considering that me and Vron were always the fastest centaur drivers. I'll get you there in well under three hours!)]

	<p>
		Deciding against engaging Astrapi in conversation, you inform her that you're going to relax and close your eyes for a while, to which the cheerful centauress replies, [astrapi.speech(Sure thing. These carriages have got the best suspension we could buy, so hopefully the ride's smooth enough for you to get some rest.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Bringing your attention to this fact, you tell Astrapi how smooth the carriage's ride has been so far, and thank her for providing such an excellent level of comfort. After that brief exchange, you do as you'd said and relax in the carriage, closing your eyes and allowing the time to pass in relative peace as the centauress takes you to Elis...

	<htmlContent tag="ASTRAPI_TALK_HISTORY"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding to pass the time by engaging Astrapi in conversation, you ask her about her history working as a centaur carriage driver, and if she and her brother have always worked together like this.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(Oh yeah, me and Vron have always worked together,)] she answers, [astrapi.speech(And as to how long we've been doing this? Well, ever since I entered the workplace the two of us were employed by a centaur carriage company, running the exact same route I'm taking you down now. As Lunette's centaurs started to get out of control, carriages started being attacked, and it didn't take long for all of our customers to disappear. Us and the other few companies working out of the depot were not far off going bankrupt and closing down, but we were hastened along with that when some of Lunette's goons attacked the depot itself and destroyed one of the barns. You saw the damage done to the roof?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Replying in the affirmative, you ask Astrapi how exactly that happened. Shaking her head as she reminisces on these bad memories, she explains, [astrapi.speech(One of the centaurs cast a spell on it. I was told afterwards by someone who knows their stuff that it was a type of earth spell. In any case, they used the arcane to summon some kind of force and it caved the roof in. A few of my friends were caught in there, and while by some miracle they were unhurt, they ended up dazed and disoriented by it and were captured by Lunette's gang. One of the perks of having an elder lilin as your leader; you can enslave and abuse anyone you want...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Sensing that Astrapi is getting angry at the thought of what Lunette's gang is responsible for, you shift the topic to what she and her brother ended up doing after their company shut down. Letting out a short sigh, she replies, [astrapi.speech(We did what we've always done; we pulled carriages. Only this time instead of transporting people and feeling like we were really providing a useful service, we were making some demon bitch rich by hauling furniture, crates, slaves, and all manner of other goods. There really wasn't much work going around, so we had no choice but to work for her, even though she treated us like shit and paid us half of what we were making before.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Wanting to move the conversation on to something more positive, you remark that now at least she and her brother are working for themselves and free from that old job. Turning her head and smiling at you, Astrapi replies, [astrapi.speech(That's right! We somehow saved up enough money to buy these carriages, and even if it means that we have to live out of a derelict barn, I'd rather be doing this than anything else. Vron feels the same way, but you might have noticed that he's not the talkative type; if you end up travelling with him then don't expect him to tell you even half of what I've told you!)]

	<htmlContent tag="ASTRAPI_TALK_COMPETITION"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding to pass the time by engaging Astrapi in conversation, you ask her about whether any other centaur carriage businesses are operating between Elis and Dominion, or if they're the only two doing this.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(As far as I know, we're the only ones,)] she answers, [astrapi.speech(There used to be a dozen or so different businesses doing what we do, but Lunette's centaurs brought an end to all that several years ago. They attacked carriages, destroyed the depot, and enslaved those of us who they could capture. Nobody wanted to risk travelling between Elis and Dominion after that, and who could blame them?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Concerned that history might repeat itself, you ask Astrapi what's stopping Lunette's centaurs from attacking the two of you out here, seeing as they've done it on numerous occasions before.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(These are why,)] she proudly replies, holding up her arms and flexing her massive biceps in a show of undeniable strength. Patting the bow on her back, she continues, [astrapi.speech(I've beaten Lunette's goons in the past, and I'll do it again if I have to; you've got nothing to fear when travelling with me. Those of them who don't fall to my bow soon find out that they're in way over their heads; I've never needed more than one punch to make Lunette's thugs drop to the dirt.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Having no reason to doubt that what Astrapi says is true, you turn the topic of conversation back to her business, and ask if there's enough customer demand to make her business a viable one. Shrugging her shoulders, she replies, [astrapi.speech(Not really, I guess, but me and Vron don't need much to be content. We only need a few customers a week to get us by; food is far cheaper out here than it is in Dominion, and we've got shelter in the form of an old barn we bought from some farmers who were leaving the Realm. Maybe if Lunette ever gets dealt with, we'll turn this business of ours into a really profitable one, but for now I'm just happy to not be working in Dominion any more.)]

	<htmlContent tag="ASTRAPI_TALK_LUNETTE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Deciding to pass the time by engaging Astrapi in conversation, you ask her about what she knows of Lunette, and whether she's ever seen her before.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(What do I know of Lunette? That she needs to be taken down,)] she answers, [astrapi.speech(I don't care if saying that is treason; it's the truth! She's destroyed this land, and if she's not dealt with soon then the Foloi Fields are going to be completely abandoned. Who knows how that'll affect the rest of the realm, but it isn't going to be good. The brave farmers who are still working the land out here are just barely managing to produce enough food to keep the cities fed. I don't know why Lilith doesn't do something about this...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Repeating your question, you ask Astrapi if she's ever seen Lunette in the flesh, or if it's just her demonic centaurs which are encountered out here.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(I haven't heard of many people who've actually seen her, but yeah, I'm one of them...)] Astrapi replies, with her voice taking on an uncharacteristically sombre tone and trailing off into silence. Not needing to be promoted, she continues speaking just a moment later, and recounts, [astrapi.speech(It was as though she'd flipped a switch overnight; one day Lunette's centaurs were no more than petty bandits, then in the space of a week a dozen farms were destroyed, an entire village burnt down, and those who couldn't offer payment were enslaved and never seen again. Several villages banded together and tried to resist, and I just so happened to be passing nearby that day...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Once again Astrapi's voice trails off into silence, only this time she doesn't show any sign of continuing her story. Not wanting to make her dig up uncomfortable memories, you start to change the topic of conversation, but the centauress cuts you off as she suddenly continues, [astrapi.speech(You know, they actually looked like they were winning. From what I could see from a mile or so away, Lunette's centaurs started to retreat from the skirmish, but then there was a flash of purple light and this huge, black-haired pegataur appeared. It was Lunette, no doubt about it. I was far too far away to hear what was said, but she simply strode forwards and must have ordered the villagers to surrender, because every single one of them dropped their weapons and knelt down to her. Lunette's thugs then turned around and charged back in, and it was all over in a couple of minutes...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Recognising that Lunette must have performed the same 'Lilith's Command' spell which her sister, Lyssieth, used on you against the villagers, you realise that they stood no chance at all against the elder lilin. As you mull this over, Astrapi shakes her head clear of the negative thoughts she's having and cheerfully proclaims, [astrapi.speech(I haven't seen her since then, and so long as she doesn't show up then I can keep you safe from her goons!)]

	<htmlContent tag="ASTRAPI_TALK_END"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		The topic of your conversation then starts to gradually shift, until eventually the two of you are making small-talk about the weather, the lack of the maintenance done on the roads, and the state of the burnt-out farmsteads and abandoned fields which you pass by. Thanks to the excellent suspension on the carriage, your journey continues to be both smooth and comfortable, and before you even know it you're approaching your destination...

	<htmlContent tag="ASTRAPI_FLIRT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You decide to pass the time by flirting with Astrapi, and begin by offering her some compliments on her impressive strength and stamina. Turning her head back and flashing you a big grin, she replies, [astrapi.speech(Me and Vron take our diet and exercise really seriously; we do a couple hours of workouts every day in addition to pulling carriages about. It's taken a while but we've built up this strength naturally; no muscle-transformation potions for us!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Continuing to talk about Astrapi's body, you ask her if her exhibitionism has ever led into any embarrassing situations. Letting out a good-natured laugh in response, she tells you about a few occasions where customers or members of the public in Dominion couldn't stop staring at her exposed boobs. Turning to wink at you, she flicks her horse-tail to one side and flashes her [astrapi.pussyColour] horse-pussy at you, adding that she's lost count of the number of people who've stopped to stare at her exposed genitalia.
	</p>
	<p>
		Coyly remarking that she could add one more to that score, you smirk at the centauress as she plays along by continually flicking her tail aside and presenting you with her animalistic pussy and puffy asshole. Seeming to be more than happy to push the boundaries of your flirting, she continues exposing herself to you while commenting on how much she likes being looked at. Soon enough, you notice that the lips of her horse-pussy start glistening a little, and you realise that Astrapi is getting seriously turned-on by your flirting. If you were to push her a little further, you think that you'd be able to get the muscular centauress horny enough to accept an offer of sex...

	<htmlContent tag="ASTRAPI_FLIRT_STOP"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Having had your fun, and not wanting to push Astrapi any further, you take things down a notch and shift your flirting into innocent small talk. The horny centauress seems to be more than a little frustrated at this, and tries several times to start talking about her exposed pussy again. Refusing to engage in any more flirting, you're surprised to hear the frustration in Astrapi's voice quickly change into one of an intense horniness.
	</p>
	<p>
		[astrapi.speech(You're so cruel,)] she whines, [astrapi.speech(You tease me like that and then stop? But you know, I've kind of got a bit of a thing for denial...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Proving her words to be true, the now-horny Astrapi continues making lewd comments and flashing you her pussy for quite some time. It's only after several more miles of travel that she eventually calms down, at which point you're finally able to shift the topic of conversation to small-talk about the weather, the lack of the maintenance done on the roads, and the state of the burnt-out farmsteads and abandoned fields which you pass by. In this manner the rest of your journey continues in an uneventful manner, and before you even know it you're approaching your destination...

	<p>
		Wanting to push Astrapi even further, you tell her that her pussy is starting to look like it's getting wet, and you ask her if she's got any pent-up sexual tension that needs to be dealt with. Although for all this time she's been pulling your carriage at an impressive rate, Astrapi hasn't once seemed to be getting out of breath, but now she pants as she responds, [astrapi.speech(You're making me like this... I can't help it... If my pussy gets wet...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Telling the centauress that she's a bad girl for getting wet while at work seems to be the last straw, and with a desperate whine, Astrapi abruptly makes a short diversion off the road. Cantering down a gravel track, she pulls up behind a half-collapsed barn, where she swiftly throws off her harness and pulls off her sports bra. Grabbing what looks like a sterility pill out of the carriage's storage box, she swallows it and demands, [astrapi.speech(You've made this problem, now you fix it! Fuck me as much as you want; I'm not going to get pregnant after taking that pill, so do whatever you want with my pussy, just make me cum!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Presenting her rear-end to you, the horny centauress flicks her tail aside and shows you her now-dripping horse-pussy. In a distinctly animal-like behaviour, her clit is rhythmically winking at you, and as she reaches up to play with her huge, [astrapi.cupSize]-cup breasts, she whines, [astrapi.speech(Come on... You want to make my pussy happy, don't you?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking at Astrapi's enticing, wet cunt, you feel like it would be very easy to respond in the positive and give this muscular centuress what she wants...

			A short while of travelling later, Astrapi calls out to you, [astrapi.speech(You can see the walls of Elis from here, look!)]
		</p>
		<p>
			Sure enough, as you look in the direction that she's pointing in, you're able to see a strip of grey on the horizon. Thanks to Astrapi's impressive speed, it only takes another couple of minutes before you're able to pick out the distinctive shape of towers embedded into the corners of the ramparts, as well as the roofs of the taller buildings within the town itself. The one which stands out the most, and the one which truly defines the town's silhouette, is the tall, highly-steepled roof of the town hall's tower.

			#ELSE
				Taking a look around at the nearby fields, you notice that they don't seem to have suffered the same sort of damage from Lunette's centaurs as those out in the Foloi Fields. Despite the apparent protection from raids, however, there doesn't appear to be a single residential building outside of the walls, giving these fields a very rural feel to them.
			#ENDIF

			The only building outside of the town's walls which you can see is the one which Astrapi is leading you to. Taking the form of a large, wooden barn, and positioned a short distance from the eastern gate of the town, this building appears to be Elis's counterpart to the twin barns back at Dominion. Confirming this to you, Astrapi calls back, [astrapi.speech(This is where we stop off. I can't take you into the town itself as there's a tax on centaur carriages passing through the gates, which I just can't afford.)]

		Although she doesn't show any sign of being fatigued from your journey, you suddenly notice that the human half of Astrapi's body is covered in a fine sheen of sweat. As you thank her for the ride, you also see that the hair on her horse's body is looking a little windblown and unkempt. As she opens the door to the barn and prepares to head inside, you take this fleeting opportunity to offer your assistance in helping to clean her.
	</p>

		Happy to oblige, you set about wiping the sweat from her pussy, while she uses a special type of brush that's fixed to the wall to rub her horse hair down. After a few minutes, and a lot of moaning and panting from Astrapi, both your jobs are done, which leads into the now-horny centauress to say, [astrapi.speech(All that's left is to wipe my human half clean. You wouldn't mind getting my back for me, would you?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she turns towards you, you see that her arousal and the relative heat of the barn has not helped with Astrapi's sweating problem, and as she uses her sweatbands to wipe the worst of it from her forehead, you see that her exposed breasts and muscular abdominal muscles are practically dripping. While you could do as Astrapi asks and simply wipe her back for her, you feel as though she'd be more than happy to accept a more lewd way of mopping up her sweat...

		Wanting to pass the time by trying to engage Vronti in conversation, you ask him about what kind of competition he and his sister face from other centaur carriage drivers. Much as you expected, he answers in a very brief manner by simply stating, [vronti.speech(Nobody else does what we do.)]

		Wanting to know a little more than that, you ask several follow-up questions, but to each one the stoic centaur replies in the shortest manner possible. After quite a few minutes spent failing to crack Vronti's unresponsive manner, you decide to give up and spend the rest of your journey in silence. Informing the centaur that you're going to relax and close your eyes for a while, Vronti once again replies in the briefest manner possible by simply saying, [vronti.speech(Ok.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Thinking to yourself how smooth the carriage's ride has been so far, you offer silent thanks to Astrapi and Vronti for clearly sparing no expense on the suspension. Thanks to the complete absence of bumps or jolts, you're able to do as you'd said and relax in the carriage, closing your eyes and allowing the time to pass in relative peace as the centaur takes you to Elis...

		Deciding that it would be fun to pass the time by flirting with Vronti, you start by offering him several suggestive compliments about how strong he is. Whether it's just an act or not, he seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that you're flirting with him, and responds to your flattery by simply grunting, [vronti.speech(Thanks.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Not one to be deterred by such an apathetic reply, you redouble your efforts and start offering the muscular centaur compliments of a more sexual nature. Telling him that you couldn't help but notice how large his cock is, you say that his partner must be a very lucky person indeed. This seems to finally be enough to get the centaur to react, and he lets out an embarrassed sigh before stating, [vronti.speech(I don't have a partner.)] 
	</p>
	<p>
		Seizing upon this fact, you coyly ask Vronti what kind of sexual partner he prefers, although now that he's realised what it is you're trying to do he completely buttons up and refuses to engage with your flirting. After spending several more minutes trying to get him to reciprocate to your flirting, it's clear that your efforts are having no effect. Letting out an annoyed sigh, you wonder what to do about this...

		Although he tries to shake his head and ignore you, for the first time since setting off on your journey you hear Vronti's breathing starting to get heavier. A little more teasing and he abruptly comes to a halt right in the middle of the road. Asking him what's wrong, you can't help but smile as Vronti curtly responds, [vronti.speech(You've given me an erection. I can't run like this.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Dismounting from the carriage, you move around to the side of Vronti and take a look at his groin. Just as he said, you see that the result of your focused flirting techniques is a huge, throbbing erection. Smirking at the blushing centaur, you wonder whether to take things all the way and offer to help him release his sexual tension...

			Sure enough, as you look in the direction that he's pointing in, you're able to see a strip of grey on the horizon.

The one which stands out the most, and the one which truly defines the town's silhouette, is the tall, highly-steepled roof of the town hall's tower.
