	<p>
		[pc.speech(Yes, I'd like to see Lyssieth now,)] you say to Elizabeth.
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(Very well, if you'll please follow me,)] she replies, opening the small wicket set into the fortress's huge wooden gates, before stepping through the doorway into Lyssieth's palace. Doing as you're instructed, you follow in Elizabeth's footsteps, and just a moment later, find yourself standing inside a staggeringly-opulent entrance hall.
	</p>
	<p>
		Gazing at the huge, high-vaulted chamber in wonder, you take note of the fact that the interior of this palace is in complete contrast to the oppressive, inhospitable appearance of the cavern's dark stone walls. The floor beneath your feet is a perfectly polished expanse of clean white marble, and is adorned with a luxuriant red runner carpet which stretches off down the three corridors that are linked to each side of the hall. The walls are covered in white, wooden panelling; their decorative, intricately-carved features are painted in bright gold. Gigantic portraits of regal-looking demons and humans hang on the walls, and up above, the high ceiling is lavishly decorated in the same white-and-gold style as the rest of your surroundings.
	</p>
	<p>
		As Elizabeth beckons you forwards, you take note of the fact that there are a couple of half-demon and human maids standing to attention on opposite sides of the hall. As you start to follow Elizabeth further into the palace, you wonder how many staff are needed to maintain and clean all of the marble statues, ornate seats, and glass-fronted display cabinets that line the walls of the palace's corridors.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="FORWARDS_1"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Stepping forwards to walk in parallel with Elizabeth, you gaze in wonder at your extravagant surroundings as the two of you proceed down the corridor that leads directly forwards from the palace's front gate.
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(It's not much further to go,)] Elizabeth says, [elizabeth.speech(just to the end of this corridor.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Letting out a quick response in acknowledgement of the information given to you, you continue looking around at the ornate statues, paintings, and display cabinets all around you. There seem to be quite a large number of the latter of these, and, while a lot of them are filled with china and other miscellaneous decorative articles, there are many which are filled with ancient-looking antiques.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Hey, I recognise those,)] you mutter, breaking off from Elizabeth to step over towards one of the display cabinets. You're certain that the collection of ancient, broken pottery is the exact same as a display you remember seeing in Lily's museum, and you turn back towards your half-demon guide as you ask, [pc.speech(Where did Lyssieth get all these relics from?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(Please, [pc.name], I'm a member of the royal guard, not a tour guide. I have no knowledge of mundane business such as that. Now, please, if we can just continue,)] Elizabeth replies, trying to suppress the annoyed tone in her voice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not satisfied by her answer, you turn to one of the human maids standing nearby, and repeat your question. Smiling, she performs a respectful curtsy, and says, [genericFemale.speech([pc.Sir], I believe that the articles to which you're referring are from Her Highness's personal collection of antiques. I apologise for knowing nothing more than that.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(Now, if we could please continue?)] Elizabeth asks.
	</p>
	<p>
		You do as instructed, but no sooner have you moved on past the next cabinet, do you suddenly spot something even more alarming. Right there, being displayed as though they're precious artefacts, are numerous bottles of fizzy drinks, bars of chocolate, and other assorted snacks. There's absolutely no doubt that these have all come from your old world, and you find yourself shaking your head in disbelief at the fact that Lyssieth is treating common junk food as though they're precious treasures.
	</p>
	<p>
		You know that neither Elizabeth nor the maids will know anything about them, so you simply continue following the captain of the royal guard as she carries on leading you forwards.
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="FORWARDS_2"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(I can tell that you're impressed by Her Highness's collections. Perhaps you can ask her more about them in a moment,)] Elizabeth says, turning to face you as the two of you reach the end of the corridor. Before you are a pair of large, ornately-carved wooden doors, and you assume that Lyssieth is within the room beyond.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Yeah, I suppose it would be interesting to find out which vending machine she must have looted,)] you reply.
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(I hope you're not insinuating that Her Highness has stolen anything,)] Elizabeth says in an icy tone. [elizabeth.speech(Unfortunately, I need to return to my post as soon as I show you through these doors, so I can't stop you from saying something you'll regret. Just remember who it is you're being given the honour of meeting, and treat Her Highness with the utmost respect. Understand?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I understand,)] you say.
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(Good. Now, there's something you need to know,)] Elizabeth continues, blushing a little as she awkwardly tries to explain, [elizabeth.speech(Her Highness, well, she likes to... That is, she respects humans a lot, and, erm... Well, she likes to take on the form of a human. You are absolutely not to judge her on that, nor are you to judge the manner in which she derives entertainment!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ok, I'm not judging,)] you reply, [pc.speech(but what do you mean, 'entertainment'?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Elizabeth flinches as you ask this, before replying [elizabeth.speech(Well, Her Highness likes to act out a certain fantasy, in which she's, erm... what did she call it... a 'chief executive officer'?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Wait, what? You mean she's role-playing as a businesswoman?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(Look, I don't question it, alright? Now, do you want to meet with her or not?!)] Elizabeth quickly blurts out, clearly flustered by having to explain Lyssieth's eccentricities to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Of course,)] you reply, breathing a sigh of relief as Elizabeth quickly steps over towards the doors in front of you. Knocking on them three times in quick succession, she opens them and steps inside, beckoning you to follow her.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="FORWARDS_3"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Following Elizabeth through the doors, you find yourself entering a room quite unlike the sort that you were expecting. Not only is Lyssieth conspicuously absent, but this area appears to be a sort of waiting room, of the same style as you might expect to see in a very prestigious office building.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of white marble, the flooring is dark, polished wood, and slightly off-centre, a large, cream-coloured rug is surrounded on three sides by low-backed black sofas. The cream-painted walls are home to numerous pieces of colourful, abstract art, and on the opposite side from which you entered, there's a single, mahogany door. In each corner of the room, there's a lush, potted plant, and, finally, a low coffee table sits in front of the sofas, and you see that there are several fashion magazines scattered across its surface.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most surprisingly of all, on the opposite side of the room to the sofas, there sits a sleek, modern-looking desk. Your eyes open wide as you see that the smartly-dressed secretary sitting behind it is none other than [siren.name] herself. While her witch's outfit has been replaced by a black pencil skirt, light-pink shirt, and black blazer, she's still wearing her white eyepatch. As she catches sight of you, she jumps to her feet
		#IF siren.getAffection(pc)<-90
		#THEN and snarls, [siren.speech(At last, we meet again, my arch-nemesis! I may not have my usual attire or weaponry, but, as you're soon to find out, my power is unmatched! Now I shall obliterate y-)]
		#ELSE
			#IF siren.getAffection(pc)<0
			#THEN and laughs, [siren.speech(At last, we meet again, my arch-nemesis! You should be thankful that we are within my mother's domain, for if it were otherwise, I would surely obliterate y-)]
			#ELSE and laughs, [siren.speech(My arch-nemesis! Y-You may have saved me before, but I am still your sworn foe! Now, behold my power! I shall obliterate y-)]
			#ENDIF
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(My Lady, please,)] Elizabeth interrupts, referring to her sister by her royal title in acknowledgement that she is a recognised daughter of Lyssieth, while she is not, [elizabeth.speech([pc.name] is an expected guest of Her Highness, and as such, is under our protection.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Clearly annoyed by this revelation, [siren.name] crosses her arms, and, pouting, collapses back down into her swivel-chair. [siren.speech(~Hrmph!~ Well, if that is the case, then I shall do my best to contain my world-shattering powers for as long as I can. B-But just know that I could destroy the two of you with a mere snap of my fingers!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[elizabeth.speech(Of course, My Lady,)] Elizabeth says, bowing and taking a step back. [elizabeth.speech(I will leave [pc.name] in your care. Please allow [pc.herHim] through to see Lyssieth as soon as possible.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Yes, yes, don't worry Lizzy, I will spare [pc.herHim] from my wrath. You can get back to your work,)] [siren.name] dismissively replies, allowing Elizabeth to turn and make her exit. As the doors close behind her, [siren.name] looks over at you, and, standing up from behind her desk, she lets out a maniacal laugh, [siren.speech(Mwhahaha! Now there's nothing to stop us from settling our feud! Deceit and trickery are tools that I never hesitate to use, and now that Lizzy is out of our way, you should prepare to meet your doom, my arch-nemesis! Now, I shall surely destroy y-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment, [siren.name] is interrupted once again, as an arcane-powered intercom sitting on her desk suddenly crackles into life, [lyssieth.speech(What on earth is all of that commotion, [siren.name]? If I have to come out there and remind you of your duties, you're going to be in serious trouble, young lady!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Instantly, [siren.name] leans down over the desk, and replies into the speaker, [siren.speech(S-Sorry, mother! I was just, erm, w-well, anyway, I was just about to inform you that your guest has arrived.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Very well, show [pc.herHim] in,)] Lyssieth replies.
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Yes, mother,)] [siren.name] responds, before addressing you as she walks over to the mahogany door, [siren.speech(Right this way, [pc.name], and don't even <i>think</i> of telling on me, ok?!)]
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="OFFICE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Giving the door a quick knock, [siren.name] opens it and steps forwards into the room beyond. Following in her footsteps, you proceed inside, and finally find yourself entering Lyssieth's office.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like the waiting room behind you, the floor is covered in dark, wooden boards, which are mostly concealed by a large, cream-coloured rug. The walls are covered in dark wooden panelling, and set into them are numerous book-filled shelves and ornately carved cabinets. In the very middle of the room, there sits a huge, mahogany desk, and on the side nearest to you, there are two empty seats. On the far side, standing beside a very expensive-looking leather chair, is Lyssieth.
	</p>
	<p>
		As Elizabeth said, the elder lilin has taken on the form of a human, and appears as a stunningly-beautiful, olive-skinned woman, who looks to be in her mid-forties. Her huge, [lyssieth.cupSize]-cup breasts threaten to spill out of her blouse's plunging neckline at any moment, and, looking down, you see that her long, perfect legs are being well shown-off by her long, black, asymmetrical skirt. Tucking a loose strand of her wavy, dark-brown hair behind one ear, the elder lilin pushes her stylish half-rim glasses up onto the bridge of her nose, before glaring at her daughter and scolding her, [lyssieth.speech(If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, young lady, take that ridiculous eye-patch off!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(M-Mom,)] [siren.name] stutters, [siren.speech(it seals my dark powers away! If I take it off, then the whole universe could be destroyed!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech([siren.Name]! You're embarrassing me in front of our guest! Now, not another word from you!)] Lyssieth says, before finally turning to face you, [lyssieth.speech(I do apologise on behalf of my troublesome daughter, and thank you so much for bringing her back to m-)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As Lyssieth's gaze comes to rest on your face, her eyes suddenly open wide, and you see the hand that's placed on the back of her chair suddenly clench tightly into the leather padding. Her calm, friendly voice completely changes to take on a deep, spine-chilling tone, and as she speaks, the ground beneath your feet almost seems to tremble, [lyssieth.speech(It's <i>you</i>?! <i>You're</i> the one who's been living with my dear Lilaya?!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you can react, the elder lilin glances behind you, and you jump a little as you hear the heavy mahogany door suddenly slam shut and lock. Fixing her gaze back onto your face, Lyssieth lets out a wild, blood-curdling laugh, before revealing that she knows exactly who you are, [lyssieth.speech(You're the one from the museum! However unwittingly, it was you who finally freed my sisters, my mother, and I from that wretched mirror! After searching for you for the past three years, you turn out to be the one who recently moved in with my precious Lilaya, and now here you are, coming to me of your own free will! Ha... Hahaha!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(M-Mom?)] [siren.name] asks, the nervousness in her voice telling you that she's just as worried by Lyssieth's behaviour as you are. [siren.speech(W-What's going on?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Ignoring her daughter, Lyssieth continues monologuing, [lyssieth.speech(After all this time, you're finally in my grasp! All I'd have to do is deliver you to mother, and, having proved my loyalty, I'd finally have my freedom returned to me! How easy it would be... To crush you right now...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As she was speaking, Lyssieth's beautiful, green eyes were slowly turning bright red, and as she comes to the end of her musings, they suddenly start glowing with a fierce, fire-like intensity. With a loud tearing, snapping noise, her grip proves too much for the poor leather chair to handle, and the back splits clean in two. Being absolutely certain that this frightful elder lilin is about to launch into an attack, you prepare to defend yourself!
	</p>

	<htmlContent tag="OFFICE_REACTION"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		You weren't expecting Lilaya's mother to give you such a hostile welcome, and, quickly dropping down into a defensive posture, you prepare to defend yourself against her incoming attack. Instead of taking any offensive action, however, Lyssieth simply laughs, and asks, [lyssieth.speech(Do you really think you stand a chance against me?! It would be but a trifle to force you to submit, and then all I'd have to do is teleport the two of us into mother's throne room, present you to her as a gift, and I'd be free!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I didn't come here to fight,)] you say, [pc.speech(let's not do anything hasty.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(You actually think you'd be able to fight back, don't you?)] Lyssieth asks, laughing once again, [lyssieth.speech(Silly [pc.race], all I'd have to do is tell you to [style.glowArcane(kneel)]!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The elder lilin's command seems to be infused with a powerful arcane spell, and as the word 'kneel' echoes around the office, you feel a powerful physical force beginning to push you down towards the floor. Simultaneously, a strange haziness settles over your mind, and you start to feel as though it would be the right thing to do to obey Lyssieth...
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="OFFICE_REACTION_RESIST"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Refusing to submit, you try to shake your head clear of the intrusive thoughts, and at the same time, you put all of your strength into resisting the crushing downwards force. From what little awareness you have left of your surroundings, you're able to make out a highly-amused smile on Lyssieth's face, and, as she steps towards you, she tuts, [lyssieth.speech(Now, now, that won't do at all. When I give people an order, they're expected to [style.glowArcane(obey)].)]
	</p>
	<p>
		The physical force pushing down on you suddenly increases in strength, and, try as you might, it's far too powerful for you to resist. As you're finally forced down onto your knees before the elder lilin, your head starts to swim, and you feel as though you're dipping in and out of conciousness. The only words that you can seem to form in your mind are 'yes' and 'mistress', but, still refusing to capitulate, you decide to stay silent instead of using your now severely-limited vocabulary.
	</p>
	]]>
	</htmlContent>
	
	<htmlContent tag="OFFICE_REACTION_SUBMIT"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		Accepting your fate, you give in to the voices of submission in your mind, and allow yourself to be pushed down onto your knees before Lyssieth. Looking up at the elder lilin, you see a highly-amused smile on her face, and, as she steps towards you, she laughs, [lyssieth.speech(Very good. If I were to tell you to surrender yourself to Lilith, allow her to drain your arcane power, and then live out the rest of your life as her slave, would you [style.glowArcane(obey)]?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		As yet another forceful command is uttered, your head starts to swim, and you feel as though you're dipping in and out of conciousness. The only words that you can seem to form in your mind are 'yes' and 'mistress', and, wanting to do as you're told, you speak them out loud, [pc.speech(Yes, Mistress...)]

		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Be quiet, [siren.name]! I... I have to!)] Lyssieth snaps, but, as your mind slowly starts to clear, you realise that she doesn't sound too sure of herself. [lyssieth.speech(I... I can't betray mother... I... But... All those people... No! If she were to discover my betrayal, I... I... But I couldn't...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Lyssieth suddenly turns away and paces back towards her desk, and as she turns her back on you, the haziness in your mind instantly clears. The physical force that was pushing down on you also immediately vanishes, but, having just borne the brunt of an elder lilin's power, you decide against making any sudden move, and stay down on your knees as you and [siren.name] witness Lyssieth's internal struggle.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Why don't I just do it?!)] she shouts to herself. You're relieved to hear that her deep, malevolent voice has shifted back to the soft, womanly one which she used to greet you. Pacing back and forth beside her desk, she throws you the occasional glance as she continues in an exasperated tone, [lyssieth.speech(I'd be a fool to go against her! I should just hand you over and be done with it! But... But then she'd regain her full power... And the humans... They'd suffer... No. I can't let that happen!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		With a final, defeated sigh, she looks down at her ruined chair, and lets out a very sad chuckle, [lyssieth.speech(Now look what I've done...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Mom? Are you ok?)] [siren.name] asks in a quivering voice, and you glance over to see that she looks to be on the verge of tears.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Yes, I'm sorry, my darling,)] Lyssieth sighs, smiling at her daughter, before looking back down at you. You see that the colour of her eyes has shifted back to a calm green, and, once again tucking a loose strand of her wavy dark-brown hair back behind her ear, she gives you an apologetic smile. [lyssieth.speech(And I'm especially sorry to you, [pc.name]. I should have known that this day would come, and that I must choose to betray Lilith. You should not have had to endure the consequence of my indecision. Please, do stand up.)]

		Doing as Lyssieth says, you push yourself up onto your [pc.feet]. Wanting now more than ever to get a real explanation of why you're here, and feeling the frustration of your seemingly never-ending quest to find out what's going on boiling over, you angrily state, [pc.speech(Look, I've been all over Dominion, trying to get someone to tell me why I'm in your world, and after finally finding Arthur, he tells me that you're the only one who has that information.

		Lyssieth spreads her arms, and beckons you and [siren.name] to approach. It doesn't look like there's any other option but to do as you're told, and so you do as the elder lilin asks.

	<htmlContent tag="OFFICE_TELEPORT_ARRIVE"><![CDATA[
	<p>
		In an instant, you, [siren.name], and Lyssieth are all standing in Lilaya's laboratory. On the other side of the room, Lilaya and Arthur are bending down over one of the many lab tables, with Rose hovering off to one side. All three of them have their backs to you, and as Lyssieth loosens her grip on you and her daughter, you realise that the trio in front of you have not noticed your sudden appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lilaya.speech(You're absolutely hopeless, you know that, right?)] Lilaya angrily scowls at Arthur, [lilaya.speech(I simply do not understand why you've never taken the time nor effort to wield the arcane yourself! Not only do you have to rely on me to do these experiments of yours, but you have the audacity to insinuate that it was <i>my</i> fault it didn't work!)]

	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Hi sis'!)] [siren.name] calls out, beaming fondly at Lilaya, and getting a warm smile in return.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(We have some important things to discuss,)] Lyssieth says, cutting the sisters' reunion short, [lyssieth.speech(Honestly, Lilaya, you should have immediately told me about [pc.name] and all this business about finding out what's going on. It would have saved you all a lot of trouble.)]

	</p>
	<p>

Along with our mother, we brought about the creation of the first human civilisations, with the intention of ruling over all of humankind as goddesses. Although we elder lilin are the only natural-born daughters of Lilith, she corrupted many, many humans into lilin as well. With their help, as well as that of their demon offspring, we easily subdued the humans,)] Lyssieth explains, [lyssieth.speech(However, after around two thousand years spent forging what would later become the Akkadian empire, the angels arrived.)]

		[lyssieth.speech(A race opposite to demons in almost every way.

Of course, he lied! So eager were we to finally capture the king of all angels, that we allowed him to trick us into gazing into the mirror. In a flash, all seven of us were transported to a sealed dimension, in which we found ourselves living in a vast, empty palace. For four thousand years, we lived in the confines of that place, but we were not alone. The seven archangels, who we'd brought along as hostages, were also transported into the mirror with us.)]

The one which Lilith gave to me, Valoel, had it better than the rest, however. Although angels are disgusting creatures, I can't help but recognise how similar to humans they are, and as such, I refused to corrupt him as my mother ordered.

		[lyssieth.speech(Correct again. You see, angels will always lose against demons, by nature of their pathetic rules of morality. Even when Samael could have imprisoned us in that mirror and thrown away the key, he chose to make a means by which we might one day be released,)] Lyssieth laughs, [lyssieth.speech(And he did that by having the soul which was to trigger our release absorb a part of Lilith's power. A tiny, tiny piece, but not entirely insignificant. Just as a single support taken out from the bottom of a tower of cards will cause the entire structure to collapse, so too did the removal of a tiny piece of Lilith's power cause her spell to backfire.)]

		[lyssieth.speech(Restrain them,)] you command, sweeping past the scarlet-skinned succubus as you set off down the palace's hallway. [lyssieth.speech(Their treachery cannot go unpunished. I will see to them later.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Orialyss falls in behind you, following in your footsteps as you make your way to where your other lilin subordinates have trapped your angelic foe. With Valoel soon to be captured, you'll finally be able to return to the comfort of your human harem, and, with that thought in mind, you can't help but grin as you step over the shattered remains of the throne room's doors and come face-to-face with the archangel himself.
	</p>
	<p>
		You feel your heart skip a beat as you see that he looks almost identical to a human, and an incredibly hot human at that. Light-skinned, with blonde hair and blue eyes, the arcahngel's masculine, handsome face turns this way and that as he prepares to defend from an attack coming from any direction. Letting your eyes wander down, you see that his tunic has been half-torn open, revealing his rippling abs and muscular chest. Pressed up against the wall behind him is the only visible mark of his angelic nature, taking the form of a pair of huge, white-feathered wings. They look a little tattered from his struggle with your sisters, and you're surprised to feel a pang of sympathy as you see the fear in his eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Shaking your head clear of such unwanted thoughts, you take note of the fact that ten of your sisters are keeping Valoel backed into his corner of the room, and by his side, he has three of his human companions. Around twenty incapacitated humans litter the floor, and you playfully bite your lip as you imagine the fun that you'll be able to have with them later on. Stepping up alongside your sisters, you carelessly sweep your hand to one side, causing the trio of humans before you to be hurled some distance across the room, where they're instantly set upon and restrained by Orialyss.
	</p>
	<p>
		[genericMale.speech(Stop it!)] Valoel weakly shouts, clutching his side in pain, [genericMale.speech(Just spare my friends, and I'll surrender!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Ha... Hahaha!)] you can't help but burst out laughing at the foolish archangel's request, and, seeing the hilarity of a defeated foe trying to make demands of you, the ten lilin start jeering and snickering at Valoel.
	</p>
	<p>
		[genericMale.speech(Foul creatures!)] the archangel shouts, and with surprising speed, he lunges directly at you, sword in hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although an immensely powerful being in his own right, he's no match for a natural-born daughter of Lilith herself, and you let out a patronising 'aww' as you easily sidestep his attack. Grabbing him by the neck, you use a blast of arcane force to swiftly disarm him, and, pulling him into your embrace, you tease, [lyssieth.speech(My, my, what a spirited thing you are! My sisters and I will have a lot of fun with you...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		At that moment, the other lilin in the room suddenly all turn to face the doorway through which you entered, and, as one, they drop down onto one knee. [genericFemale.speech([style.glowArcane(Most impressive, Lyssieth. As a reward, you may keep that creature as your pet.)])]
	</p>
	<p>
		Hearing the voice of your mother behind you, you turn to face her. A vague shape of a naked woman, more beautiful than any you could ever imagine, is the last thing you see before starting to come back to your senses...

	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(No, but if you <i>were</i> a demon, I think that you'd be able to shift into a human form, exactly as I've done right now.

		[lyssieth.speech(She doesn't understand.

I'm sorry for thrusting all this responsibility upon you, but you really are the only person who can stop Lilith from wiping out all of humanity. I need to return to fetch [siren.name] now, so if you could please excuse me. Oh, and please do come back at any time if you have more questions,

	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ok, I'll be sure to return,)] you say, heading over to the door of Lyssieth's office.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(I wish I could do more to help you, but with Lilith keeping a close watch on my movements, I can't do much,)] Lyssieth says, [lyssieth.speech(I doubt you've heard of them, as the general population is kept from owning any type of long-range communication device, but I'll give Lilaya a resonance stone. She can use it to contact me at any time, so if you want to visit me without walking all the way down here, just let Lilaya know, and I'll quickly teleport to her lab and bring you back. Anyway, goodbye for now!)]

	<p>
		With that, Lyssieth disappears in a flash of purple light. Not wanting to still be loitering around when she returns, you push open the door and step out into the adjoining waiting room...

		Not feeling comfortable about using Lyssieth's lap as a pillow, you tell her that you're feeling better, before standing up and turning to face her as she does the same. Deciding to let her know about what you saw, you say, [pc.speech(I had a strange vision while I was passed out. I was seeing things from your perspective, when you and your sisters captured the archangel Valoel.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(I certainly didn't expect you to witness my memories,)] Lyssieth sighs, [lyssieth.speech(But I have nothing to hide. As I told you earlier, my sisters and I captured all of the archangels before we were imprisoned in the mirror. The only one that got away was their leader, Samael.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(And you still haven't found him?)] you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Mother is still searching, but no, he's out there somewhere, hiding,)] Lyssieth answers. [lyssieth.speech(But anyway, the essence infusion was far more successful than I imagined it could be, and now that you seem to be feeling better, I should let you know how it's changed your aura.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I think I can feel it,)] you say, [pc.speech(It feels as though I have a lot more energy available to me now.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Yes, that was the expected effect, along with immunity to the 'Lilith's Command' spell which we lilin are able to cast,)] Lyssieth replies, [lyssieth.speech(But I felt something else changing within your aura. As I channelled my essence into it, I detected a part of it <i>unlocking</i>, in a very similar manner to how a person's aura changes when...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Lyssieth's voice trails off mid-sentence, and, realising that something's off, you ask, [pc.speech(When what?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Well, when I corrupt someone into a demon,)] she replies, [lyssieth.speech(I haven't corrupted anyone like that for years now, as I hate doing it, but I remember exactly how it feels. Yours felt different, however, and my intuition is telling me that I somehow gave you a fraction of my transformative abilities.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Wait, so I can transform myself at will, like a demon?)] you ask.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(No, but if you <i>were</i> a demon, I think that you'd be able to shift into a human form, exactly as I've done right now. I imagine that when you gain the essences of my elder lilin sisters, you'll gain more and more transformative powers, until eventually you become a fully-fledged lilin yourself. Well, if you were already a demon, that is...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(But I'm not a demon, am I?)] you ask, [pc.speech(Your power definitely didn't change me like that, did it? I mean, I certainly don't feel like I've turned into a demon, but just to make sure...)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(Oh, no, trust me, you'd know if you were a demon,)] Lyssieth softly laughs, [lyssieth.speech(Please don't ask me to turn you into one, either. I... I really hate doing it, you see... And also if I were to turn you into a demon, then Lilaya would certainly never forgive me.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ah, yes, she does seem to want to be a full demon,)] you recall.
	</p>
	<p>
		[lyssieth.speech(She doesn't understand. I don't want to corrupt her like that, and take away what humanity she has left,)] Lyssieth explains, [lyssieth.speech(But anyway, you seem to be fully recovered now, [pc.name]. I'm sorry for thrusting all this responsibility upon you, but you really are the only person who can stop Lilith from wiping out all of humanity.

		Finally getting a moment to yourself, the revelation that this world is in fact your own has time to sink in. Although Lilaya has the same soul, and bears resemblance to your aunt in many ways, you realise that you're never going to see Lily again. Walking over to the nearest sofa, you collapse down onto it and rest your head in your hands.
	</p>
	<p>
		You aren't sure for how long you sit there for, thinking about things, but before you know it, you hear the door to Lyssieth's office open, before the familiar voice of [siren.name] calls out, [siren.speech(Oh, [pc.name], you're still here? Hey, are you ok?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Sitting back upright, you reply, [pc.speech(Yeah, just a lot to think about, I suppose.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		#IF siren.getAffection(pc)<-25
		#THEN
			[siren.speech(You know, I still haven't forgiven you for abandoning me in my citadel like that,)] [siren.name] says, walking back over to her desk and sitting down in her chair, [siren.speech(And no matter what, you're still my arch nemesis! But... Thanks for helping mom like this... I guess you can't be too bad after all...)]
		#ELSE
			[siren.speech(You know, you're still my arch-nemesis,)] [siren.name] says, walking back over to her desk and sitting down in her chair, [siren.speech(And one day we shall duel to decide the fate of the universe! But... I just want to say... Thanks for helping mom like this...)]
		#ENDIF
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I just hope that I can get the help of your friend,)] you reply, turning your thoughts to Lunette and her herd of demonic centaurs. [pc.speech(You said she's probably in the town of 'Elis'?)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Yeah, that's right. Oh, and mom said to give you this map. It's got Elis marked on it, so you won't lose your way,)] [siren.name] says, placing a folded paper map on the desk in front of her.

		Standing up from the sofa, you step over to [siren.namePos] desk and take the offered map. Looking down at the parchment in your [pc.hands], you see that it depicts a large area, measuring 150 square kilometres around Dominion. There looks to be a large amount of farmland surrounding the capital, which is bordered by an expanse of wild grassland and forests. To the north, there's a huge expanse of what's marked as jungle, while to the south, the farmland transitions first into a wide savannah, and then into a desert.
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Elis is here,)] [siren.name] says, pointing to a mark west of Dominion. You look across to see that the town is just a few kilometres to the east of the area marked as the 'Shinrin highlands', and that it looks to be roughly 35km from Dominion itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(I don't suppose there's any transport available?)] you ask, [pc.speech(It's going to take me around five or six hours to walk there.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(If you can teleport like mom can, then once you've been there once, you can just return there in an instant,)] [siren.name] says, [siren.speech(But otherwise, no, it's all walking.)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[pc.speech(Ok,)] you say, taking a picture of the map with your phone for quick reference, [pc.speech(I'm sure I'll be back soon, bye, [siren.name].)]
	</p>
	<p>
		[siren.speech(Bye, [pc.name], oh, and you're obviously free to come and go from our palace as you please, but just listen to the maids if they tell you some areas are off-limits,)] [siren.name] says, before letting out a laugh and leaning back in her chair, [siren.speech(The next time we meet, I shall surely best you in a duel!)]
	</p>
	<p>
		Pushing open the door to [siren.namePos] office, you step back out into the palace corridor, and wonder what to do next...
