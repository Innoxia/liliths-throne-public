	<!-- The region which this map is associated with.
	Values can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/world/WorldRegion.java -->
	<worldRegion>FIELD_CITY</worldRegion>
	
	<!-- The name of this map. -->
	<name><![CDATA[Elis]]></name>
	
	<!-- The colour which should be used for this map (will affect the colouring of the name of the map in the game's UI).
	You can define this as either a PresetColour value or a raw colour hex.
	If defining a raw colour hex, use this format: <colour>#cafe69</colour>
	Values can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/utils/colours/PresetColour.java -->
	<colour>BASE_GREEN_LIGHT</colour>
	
	<!-- A reason why a character can't have sex in this location (only affects masturbation and sex with companions - sex scenes will still work if the dialogue allows for them).
	This supports conditional statements, with 'npc' being the character who is being checked to see if they are able to have sex (this will almost certainly always be the player).
	This can be overridden by the 'sexBlockedReason' value of the place type in which the character is located.
	If left blank, or omitted entirely, then characters can freely have sex in this world type.
	Characters can have sex in this world type, so I've left it blank, but if you wanted to define a value, it would look like this:
		<sexBlockedReason><![CDATA[[npc.Name] cannot have sex here!]]></sexBlockedReason> -->
	<sexBlockedReason/>
	
	<!-- Whether or not there is furniture present in this area.
	This value determines whether or not 'over-desk' and 'on chair' sex positions are available in this world type.
	This value can be overridden by a value defined in the cell's place type, so this value should be treated just as a default value for the world type's average tile.
	Use either 'true' or 'false' as values (will default to false if omitted). -->
	<furniturePresent>false</furniturePresent>
	
	<!-- Whether or not there are walls present in this area.
	This value determines whether or not the 'against wall' sex position is available in this  world type.
	This value can be overridden by a value defined in the cell's place type, so this value should be treated just as a default value for the world type's average tile.
	Use either 'true' or 'false' as values (will default to false if omitted).
	You can add the optional attribute 'wallName' to change the name of what's acting as the wall in this world type (it will be used in contexts such as 'Against X' and '... push her up against a nearby X.' where X is the value of the wallName attribute).
	The default name is 'wall'.
		e.g. <wallsPresent wallName="tree">true</wallsPresent> -->
	<wallsPresent>true</wallsPresent>
	
	<!-- Whether or not the player can loiter (pass time without encountering anything) in this map.
	Use either 'true' or 'false' as values.
	Note: This can be overridden in a place type's definition, so even if you set loitering to be enabled or disabled here, the actual place in which the player is located might have different behaviour, which has priority over this definition. -->
	<loiteringEnabled>true</loiteringEnabled>
	
	<!-- Whether or not it's possible for characters to fly in this map - will usually be true in outdoor places and false indoors.
	Use either 'true' or 'false' as values. -->
	<flightEnabled>true</flightEnabled>
	
	<!-- Whether or not this map has all of its tiles already discovered upon creation (i.e. the tile types are all visible to the player, but they are greyed-out as though the player has never visited them before).
	Use either 'true' or 'false' as values. -->
	<visibleFromStart>true</visibleFromStart>
	
	<!-- Whether or not this map has all of its tiles already discovered and fully revealed (i.e. the tile types are all visible to the player, and they are also fully visible as though the player has visited them before).
	Please note that if defined as true, then this value overrides the 'visibleFromStart' behaviour above.
	Use either 'true' or 'false' as values. -->
	<fullyRevealedFromStart>false</fullyRevealedFromStart>
	
	<!-- The AbstractPlaceType which is the location of this area within the world map.
	It should be a value from the WORLD_MAP_ values located at the bottom of this file: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/world/places/PlaceType.java -->
	<globalMapLocation>WORLD_MAP_FIELDS_CITY</globalMapLocation>
	
	<!-- The most common AbstractPlaceType for this map.
	This is	only ever used as a backup value in the code, and so don't worry too much about what value you use here.
	It should be a value that corresponds to an AbstractPlaceType id (most likely one which you've defined within the 'placeTypes' folder that should be located alongside this file). -->
	<standardPlace>innoxia_fields_elis_town_street</standardPlace>
	
	<!-- The AbstractPlaceType in which the player will be placed when entering this map from the world map.
	It should be a value that corresponds to an AbstractPlaceType id (most likely one which you've defined within the 'placeTypes' folder that should be located alongside this file).
	Note: This is very rarely used, as entering a new map is typically handled without using this value. As such, don't worry too much about what place type you use for this. -->
	<entryFromGlobalMapLocation>innoxia_fields_elis_town_entry_east</entryFromGlobalMapLocation>
	
	<!-- The teleport permissions which this map supports.
	You can find values here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/world/TeleportPermissions.java -->
	<teleportPermissions>BOTH</teleportPermissions>
	
	<!-- A list of places which are found within this map.
	The 'place' entries should have a 'colour' attribute which corresponds to the colour hex on the map.png file which should be located alongside this file.
	The value itself should once again be a value that corresponds to an AbstractPlaceType id (most likely one which you've defined within the 'placeTypes' folder that should be located alongside this file).
	I separate groups of associated place types simply for readability, but there's no need to leave spaces between lines if you prefer making it more compact. -->
