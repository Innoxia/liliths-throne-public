				As the pill slides down [npc.namePos] throat, [npc.she] [npc.verb(assume)] there's little effect to be felt, but suddenly a powerful cramp takes hold of [npc.her] stomach!

					[npc.Name] [npc.verb(feel)] [npc.her] ovaries kick into overdrive as eggs begin to cascade towards [npc.her] womb. As the discomfort fades, [npc.she] [npc.verb(realise)] that [npc.sheIs] now able to be impregnated with far more children than [npc.she] would normally be able to
					#IF(pc.hasFetish(FETISH_PREGNANCY))

					#IF(npc.hasPenisIgnoreDildo())
						 The feeling doesn't stop there, however, as the cramp quickly moves down into [npc.her] groin. [npc.She] [npc.verb(feel)] [npc.her] testes churning as they produce sperm at a supernatural rate. The discomfort eventually fades, and [npc.she] [npc.verb(realise)] that any womb that [npc.her] semen finds its way into will be able to carry far more children than it normally
