			The small print on the front of the card explains that platinum accounts are only given out to direct descendants of elder lilin, and as such your card has been marked to identify you as being of Lyssieth's lineage. It has been verified with three arcane stamps, which glow when the card is in possession of its rightful owner. A warning on the front instructs citizens to immediately notify the nearest Enforcer if the stamps are not glowing.
