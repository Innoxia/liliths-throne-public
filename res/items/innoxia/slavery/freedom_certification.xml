			While the text is extremely boring legal-talk, the enchanted paper upon which its printed is quite interesting, as no matter how you bend or even attempt to tear it, it seems impossible to inflict any sort of damage to it. Both the signature and the wax seal at the bottom of the page are a dark purple in colour, and both appear to also be enchanted, as they emit a steady, faint purple glow.
