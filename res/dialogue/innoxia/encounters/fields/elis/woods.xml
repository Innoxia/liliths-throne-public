		<!-- This is a conditional statement which is executed before the scene's dialogue is parsed.
		This allows you to make any gameplay changes before the scene is presented to the player (which can be very useful for making sure that transformed characters get parsed correctly).
		You may sometimes find yourself wishing to apply gameplay changes, then parsing some text, making more changes, then parsing that text.
			e.g. Move a masculine character into a new tile, parse their dialogue, transform their femininity, parse their dialogue - which would now be pink after the transformation.
			If you require that behaviour, then leave the 'content' element below blank (so that no text is parsed by default), and using the game.appendToTextStartStringBuilder() and game.appendToTextEndStringBuilder() methods within this 'preParsingEffects' element.
			If you want to use the above methods with text that's parsed from an xml file, use:
				game.parseFromFile(String pathName, String tag, GameCharacter... specialNPCs)
				e.g.: [#game.parseFromFile('txt/encounters/fields/elis/woods', 'FIND_BERRIES')]
				And in the appendToTextStartStringBuilder method: [#game.appendToTextStartStringBuilder(game.parseFromFile('txt/encounters/fields/elis/woods', 'FIND_BERRIES'))]
		The conditional statements which you put into this element will only ever be parsed once, immediately before the scene is displayed to the player.
		If you require effects to be parsed after the scene, then use the effects element in responses. -->

		<!-- This is where the scene's content is defined - it's not directly located within these dialogue files as splitting the framework from the content makes everything a lot easier to read and debug (as changes to the dialogue can be reflected and therefore tested without needing to recompile or restart the game).
		The 'folderPath' attribute is the path from your lilithsthrone/res folder to the xml file in which your content is written.
			The game should recognise forward slashes as appropriate file separators for the player's operating system, so even if you don't normally use forward slashes, please use them in 'folderPath' definitions.
		The text value within this 'content' element (in this case 'FIND_BERRIES') points to the actual piece of dialogue within the file specified in 'folderPath'.
			This value is defined as the 'tag' attribute in the dialogue's 'htmlContent' element.

		You can set the 'minutes' attribute to true to make your value represent minutes instead of seconds - in this example, 5 minutes will be passed, but if 'minutes' was false, then 5 seconds would be passed.

		I usually define this as true when the scene forms part of a multi-scene conversation, or in any other case when this scene is logically part of whatever has happened prior to it.
		I don't want an encounter to display the tile's default dialogue above it (which is what would be the scene prior to this), so I'll leave this as false.

		You can omit this value entirely if you want, in which case it will default to false (or true if travelDisabled is true).
			NOTE: This will always be true regardless of what you put here if the 'travelDisabled' element above is true (this is because some items could potentially move the player out of the scene, so if a scene's travel is disabled, items must be too.)

		<!-- Responses: -->
		<!-- The actual content and handling of a scene is only half of what a dialogue node is about.
		As equally important as what the player reads is what choices you give to them next.
		That's handled by 'response' elements, which determine which dialogue node is shown to the player next, and which can also apply effects.
		Note: I use 'response' as the name for actions which are presented to the payer in scenes, so 'response' and 'action' can be used interchangeably. -->
		
		<!-- You can define tabs for responses here (tabs being the same 'self', 'sex actions' etc. tabs that are present during sex scenes).
		Important note: If you don't use consecutive indexing for your tabs, then those that come after a missing tab will not work!
			i.e. You need to define tabs of index of 0 and 1 in order to have a tab with index of 2. -->
		<responseTabs>
			<!-- This dialogue node doesn't require any tabs, but I've added this one to present you with an example.
			The 'index' attribute determines the position of the tab, and starts at 0 and goes up to a MAXIMUM of 4. (Any values over 4 will be discarded.)
			The contents of this element supports conditional statements, and if an empty value is returned (whitespace is not taken into account) then the tab will not be present in the scene.
			Whatever text is returned by this element will be the tab's title. -->
			<tab index="0"><![CDATA[
				#IF(false)
					This will never be seen!
				#ENDIF
			]]></tab>
			<tab index="1"><![CDATA[
				#IF(false)
					Neither will this!
				#ENDIF
			]]></tab>
		</responseTabs>
		
		<!-- Finally, this is the section in which the actual responses to the scene are defined.
		You can have as many responses as you'd like.
		With that being said, please bear in mind:
			The response in index 0 is displayed as the bottom-right action to the player, which I often reserve for 'back'/'return' actions.
			Responses of an index of 15 or higher will only be displayed to the player if the previous 14 actions are used, and will be on the next 'page' of responses, which are unlikely to get as much attention from the player as the actions on the first page.
				As such, you should really try to limit your number of responses to under 15.
		You can define an optional attribute 'copyFromDialogueId' to define a dialogue node from which to copy responses for this dialogue node.
			For example, to make this dialogue node have the same responses as the 'berries_eaten' dialogue node below, you'd define it as so:
				<responses copyFromDialogueId="innoxia_encounters_fields_elis_woods_berries_eaten"/>
			Please note that by doing this the responseTabs will also be copied from the dialogue node defined, and so you don't need to define responseTabs above.
			Additional note: You can still define responses and response tabs when using the 'copyFromDialogueId' attribute.
				When doing so, the game will prioritise using the responses/tabs you've defined, and then fall back on those from the 'copyFromDialogueId' element.
				In this manner, it is possible to override responses defined in the dialogue node from 'copyFromDialogueId'. -->
		<responses>
			<!-- Sometimes you might want to vary the properties of a response based on gameplay variables.
			As such, all of the elements within a response support conditional statements. -->
			<response>
				<!-- You can define a conditional here to allow this response to be presented to the player or not.
				You can omit this entirely, in which case this response will always be available.
				It should return either 'true' or 'false' (trailing or leading whitespace is ignored). -->
				<availabilityConditional><![CDATA[true]]></availabilityConditional>
			
				<!-- The index of the responseTab in which this response can be found.
				This must be either 0 (default value) or an index of a tab that you've defined up above in the 'responseTabs' element. -->
				<responseTabIndex><![CDATA[0]]></responseTabIndex>
				
				<!-- The position of this response within the actions panel at the bottom of the UI.
				Please return a positive integer, ideally within the range of 0-14.
				Multiple responses can have the same index, provided that the 'availabilityConditional' above is configured in such a way as to make them mutually exclusive. -->
				<index><![CDATA[1]]></index>
				
				<!-- The title of this response, as seen by the player on the action button. -->
				<responseTitle><![CDATA[Continue]]></responseTitle>
				
				<!-- The tooltip contents of this response, as seen by the player when they hover their mouse over this response's action button. -->
				<responseTooltip><![CDATA[You don't think that eating wild berries is a very wise thing to do, and so decide to leave them untouched and continue on you way.]]></responseTooltip>
				
				<!-- The colour of the title's text, which should most likely be omitted or left blank, as action colouring should only be used to let the player know the action leads to combat, sex, trade, or a quest (which apart from quests are handled automatically).
				You can define this as either a PresetColour value or a raw colour hex.
				If defining a raw colour hex, use this format: <colour>#cafe69</colour>

				<colour><![CDATA[TEXT]]></colour>
				
				<!-- The next dialogue node to progress to after selecting this action.
				The values 'default' and 'defaultWithEncounter' are special values which correspond to:
					'default': The default dialogue in which the player is located. This will not generate any random encounter.
					'defaultWithEncounter': The default dialogue in which the player is located. This has the tile's standard chance of generating a random encounter.
					'defaultForceEncounter': The default dialogue in which the player is located. This will guarantee that a random encounter is generated, if one is available. This is useful for 'Explore' actions.
					'null' and 'empty': No dialogue will be linked, in which case the button will appear to the player but be greyed-out.
				You can add an attribute named 'defaultPlaceType' if you want this response to link to a default dialogue of another place type.
					To use, simply define the 'defaultPlaceType' attribute as an id of the PlaceType you want to link to.
					The dialogue will not have a random encounter.
					e.g.: <nextDialogue defaultPlaceType="innoxia_fields_elis_tavern"/>
				You can also choose to leave this element blank or omit it entirely, in which case this response will act as an 'effects only' response, and will not proceed into a new scene.
					While this can be useful for applying effects without transitioning into a new scene, you're probably not ever going to need to use this behaviour.
				The 'stripContent' attribute, when defined as 'true', leads into the defined dialogue node as usual, but doesn't display its usual content to the player.
					This can be useful to do if you want a response to lead into a pre-defined dialogue node, but you want to change the usual content via using the 'game.appendToTextStartStringBuilder()' or 'game.appendToTextEndStringBuilder()' methods.
					A typical example of this is when leading back into the tile's default dialogue node, but you want to display a description of the player continuing on their journey instead of the tile's usual content.
					This will only have an effect if this response is not a trading, combat, or sex response.
				You can also define an additional 'forceContinue' attribute, which if set to 'true' will make the next dialogue node act as though its 'continuesDialogue' variable is true.
					i.e. If I defined this field as such:
						<nextDialogue forceContinue="true"><![CDATA[default]]></nextDialogue>
						Then the next scene would have the default tile's content appended to the end of the current content, even though the default dialogue likely has 'continuesDialogue' set to false. -->
				<nextDialogue stripContent="false"><![CDATA[default]]></nextDialogue>
				
				<!-- This is an optional element which, when included, takes priority over the next dialogue node's 'secondsPassed' value.
					i.e. If a dialogue node declares 60 seconds to pass, but a response which leads into that dialogue node instead declares 30 seconds to pass, then 30 seconds will pass when the player selects the response instead of 60.
				The 'minutes' attribute works exactly like the 'secondsPassed' element for the dialogue node above. -->
				<secondsPassed minutes="true"><![CDATA[5]]></secondsPassed>
		
				<!-- This is executed once when selecting the response, before the next dialogue node's preParsingEffects are called.
				You can use this to define special effects as a result of selecting this response.
				Effects are applied *before* the next scene is loaded. -->
