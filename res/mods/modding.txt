***** MODDING *****

If you want to make mods, make a new folder, using the (hopefully unique) name of your mod. (Like the 'innoxia' folder in this directory.)

Currently supported directories:
CLOTHING MODS: res/mods/(yourName)/items/clothing
TATTOO MODS: res/mods/(yourName)/items/tattoos
WEAPON MODS: res/mods/(yourName)/items/weapons
PATTERN MODS: res/mods/(yourName)/items/patterns
OUTFIT MODS: res/mods/(yourname)/outfits/(descriptiveFolderName)
SET BONUS MODS: res/mods/(yourname)/setBonuses
STATUS EFFECT MODS: res/mods/(yourname)/statusEffects
COLOUR MODS: res/mods/(yourname)/colours
RACE MODS: res/mods/(yourname)/race
COMBAT MOVE MODS: res/mods/(yourname)/combatMove
DIALOGUE FLAGS AND NODES: res/mods/(yourname)/dialogue/
ENCOUNTERS: res/mods/(yourname)/encounters/
SEX ACTIONS AND MANAGERS: res/mods/(yourname)/sex/
	(probably best to keep them separate in actions and managers folders within that directory)
MAPS: res/mods/(yourname)/maps/
	(follow the standard of putting a new map in a named folder and then placeTypes folder, map.png for the map file, and worldType.xml for the map data)

Just to clarify, (yourName) should be whatever nickname the mod creator is using, or any unique name which encompasses everything inside your created mod folder (e.g. 'beeModding').


Within these mod folders (which you create), place the .xml and .svg files that are needed for each piece of clothing/tattoo.

I've included at least one example in each directory for you to reference (the 'clothing' example is in the 'template' folder). If you need any help, there is a 'mod-discussion' channel in the LT discord. ^^

Commented examples not found in the mod folder can be found here:
Patterns:
	res/patterns/irbynx/camo.xml for patterns
Dialogue:
	res/dialogue/innoxia/flags.xml for dialogue flags
	res/dialogue/innoxia/encounters/fields/elis/woods.xml for dialogue nodes
Encounters:
	res/encounters/elis/woodland.xml for encounters
Maps:
	res/maps/fields/elis/town/worldType.xml folder for new maps
	res/maps/fields/elis/town/placeTypes/entry_east.xml for place types
Sex:
	res/sex/innoxia/managers/meraxis/duel/masturbation.xml for sex managers
	res/sex/innoxia/actions/meraxis/duel/orgasm_panties_cum.xml for sex actions



***** Optimizing SVG images *****

Once you have made your .svg images, you can optimise them (so that the game runs faster when rendering them), by doing the following:

1) All <flowRoot> elements should be manually removed (open your svg file in a text editor to do this). These are randomly added by Inkscape when dragging things in the editor and serve no purpose since they technically don't even exist in SVG 1.1, which all the files use.

2) Automated optimization can be done using SVGO (note 1), a relatively simple command line tool. The configuration used is included (note 2) and contains instructions on how to use it.
