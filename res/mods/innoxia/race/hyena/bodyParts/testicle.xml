	<!-- The singular/plural names of this testicle when on a masculine character.
	One of the defined names will be chosen at random every time the name is displayed to the player.
	These should probably be left empty so that the game's default names are used.

	<names>
		<name><![CDATA[ball]]></name>
		<name><![CDATA[testicle]]></name>
	</names> -->

	Additional testicle descriptors are generated based on the testicle's properties (such as their size, count, etc.), so these descriptors should only be related to the race itself. -->

	<!-- Hyena testicles do not need any racial descriptors, but if you wanted to add some, use this format:
	<descriptors>
