	<!-- Whether or not this penis type can have pubic hair growing around it.
	As a character's pubic hair is shared between their penis and vagina, I've taken the decision to give penis type priority in determining whether or not pubic hair is allowed (as the penis is above the vagina, it seemed logical to do it that way).
		As such, if a character's vagina type does not allow pubic hair, but their penis type does, then they can grow pubic hair.
		Conversely, if a character's vagina type does allow pubic hair, but their penis type does not, then they cannot grow pubic hair.
		As an aside, a character lacking both penis and vagina cannot grow pubic hair.
	By default, penis types allow pubic hair if its race is of either the MAMMAL or BIRD RacialClass. As such, this penis type would allow pubic hair even if this element was omitted (as hyenas are of the MAMMAL class), but I've included it here for demonstration purposes.
	You should define this as either 'true' or 'false', or, if you'd like to leave it to its default value, then leave this element blank or omit it entirely. -->

	<!-- Any special changes which should be applied to a newly-spawned penis of this type.
	The character who is in possession of this penis can be accessed via the 'npc' tag.
	[#SPECIAL_PARSE_0] will parse to either true or false, corresponding to whether or not this change is being applied before (false) or after (true) the character has been given this penis type. -->
