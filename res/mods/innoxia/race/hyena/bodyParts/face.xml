	<!-- Whether or not this face type can have a beard growing on it.
	By default, face types allow beards if its race is of either the MAMMAL or BIRD RacialClass. As such, this face type would allow a beard even if this element was omitted (as hyenas are of the MAMMAL class), but I've included it here for demonstration purposes.
	You should define this as either 'true' or 'false', or, if you'd like to leave it to its default value, then leave this element blank or omit it entirely. -->
