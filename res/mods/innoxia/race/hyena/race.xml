	<!-- Core definitions: -->
	
	<!-- The id for this race's associated RacialBody.
	This should most often be the 'racialBody.xml' file found alongside this 'race.xml' file, and will follow the id generation of 'author_raceName'. -->

	<!-- Any special changes which should be applied to a newly-spawned character of this race.
	This is applied *before* individual Subspecies' 'applySubspeciesChanges' method.
	The character's body that's being changed can be accessed via using 'targetedBody'.
	The code here is redundant, as clitoris girth is set to 4 in the racialBody.xml file, and modified in the spotted and striped subspecies files, but I've added it in here to show a working example. -->

	<!-- You can also define names for use in the game's silly mode by creating elements identical to the 'name' and 'namePlural' ones above, but instead calling them 'nameSillyMode' and namePluralSillyMode.
	See the 'res/race/NoStepOnSnek/snake/race.xml' file for an example in use. -->

	<!-- The colour of this race.

	<!-- Whether this race can be transformed into a feral form or not.
	This should typically be left as true, unless the race you are creating has no animal equivalent (examples of a false value would be for humans, demons, and angels). -->

	<!-- Gameplay preferences: -->
	
	<!-- In a new game using completely default settings, what level of 'furry' should this race be for females and males.
	Provided that you allow the player to adjust this via the content settings, this value isn't really too important, and should probably be left as 'NORMAL' unless there's a specific reason to change it.

	<defaultMasculinePreference>NORMAL</defaultMasculinePreference>
	
	<!-- Whether or not the player can change this race's default furry level via the content settings screen.
	This should probably be left as 'true', but if you want to make a race like harpies, which requires all newly-spawned characters to be created at a 'NORMAL' level of FurryPreference, then set this to false. -->
