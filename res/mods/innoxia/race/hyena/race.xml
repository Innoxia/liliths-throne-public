	<!-- The id for this race's associated RacialBody.
	This should most often be the 'racialBody.xml' file found alongside this 'race.xml' file, and will follow the id generation of 'author_raceName'. -->

	<!-- Any special changes which should be applied to a newly-spawned character of this race.
	This is applied *before* individual Subspecies' 'applySubspeciesChanges' method.
	The character's body that's being changed can be accessed via using 'targetedBody'.
	e.g.:
		<applyRaceChanges><![CDATA[
			[#targetedBody.getVagina().getClitoris().setGirth(null, 4)]
		]]></applyRaceChanges>

	<!-- You can also define names for use in the game's silly mode by creating elements identical to the 'name' and 'namePlural' ones above, but instead calling them 'nameSillyMode' and namePluralSillyMode.
	See the 'res/race/NoStepOnSnek/snake/race.xml' file for an example in use. -->
	
	<!-- The non-gendered name and plural name of this race when in feral form.
		The name corresponds to the name of this race when in the 'legConfiguration' form defined. 
		LegConfiguration values can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/character/body/valueEnums/LegConfiguration.java
		(Just use 'BIPEDAL' if you're unsure of what to use, and the game will handle the rest.)
		You can add the optional parameter 'affinity' to name elements to handle cases where the name should differ based on whether or not there are multiple subspecies which have the same legConfiguration.
			e.g.:
			<name legConfiguration="TAIL_LONG" affinity="AQUATIC"><![CDATA[sea-snake-hyena]]></name>
			<name legConfiguration="TAIL_LONG"><![CDATA[snake-hyena]]></name>

	<!-- Whether this race can be transformed into a feral form or not.

	Provided that you allow the player to adjust this via the content settings, this value isn't really too important, and should probably be left as 'NORMAL' unless there's a specific reason to change it.
