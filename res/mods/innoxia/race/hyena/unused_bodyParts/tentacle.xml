	This will almost always be the id of the race in which this type is found (in this case hyena). -->

	<!-- The id of the material covering this tentacle.
	The id will typically take the form of 'innoxia_hyena_fur'.

	<!-- Tags which are associated with this tentacle type.
	You should most likely only be using the 'tail' tags for your tentacle type (the game re-uses tail tags for tentacles as the two body parts are very similar to one another).
	You should define NONE of the 'TAIL_TYPE_X' tags.
	You should define ONE of the 'TAIL_TAPERING_X' tags.
	The other tags are optional, but will most likely always include all three of 'TAIL_PREHENSILE', 'TAIL_SUTABLE_FOR_PENETRATION', and 'TAIL_SLEEP_HUGGING'.
	Values can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/character/body/tags/BodyPartTag.java -->

	<!-- The singular and plural determiners of this tentacle type.
	These are used in the format 'Lilaya has one X tentacle.', where X is the determiner.
	As such the determiner should almost always be left blank.
	For an example of where determiners need to be defined, harpy tentacles are called 'tentacle feathers', so the determiner should be 'plume of'/'plumes of', to fit into: 'Helena has one X tentacle feathers.' -->
