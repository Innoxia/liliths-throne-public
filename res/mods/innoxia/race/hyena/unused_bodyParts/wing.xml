	<!-- IMPORTANT!!!
	Instead of making a new wing type, you should almost certainly be using the pre-defined wing types FEATHERED or LEATHERY
	These can be seen here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/character/body/types/WingType.java -->

	<!-- The id of the race which this wing belongs to.
	This will almost always be the id of the race in which this type is found (in this case hyena). -->

	<!-- The id of the material covering this wing.
	The id will typically take the form of 'innoxia_hyena_fur'.

	<!-- Whether this is a generic wing type or not (use the values 'true' or 'false' here).
		Generic wing types are not associated with any race and therefore can be inherited by any race of wingless offspring, and should be defined as true if this wing type could be applied to any sort of race (such as the default 'feathered', 'leathery', and 'insect' wing types in the base game).
		Will most likely be left as false here.  -->
