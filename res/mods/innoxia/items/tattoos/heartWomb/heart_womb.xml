	<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION: If you are unsure of anything, please use the LT Discord to ask for help!
	Your tattoo's id (which is very important to the game), is calculated from your tattoo's folder and .xml name using the following code:
		modAuthorDirectory.getName()+"_"+innerChild.getParentFile().getName()+"_"+innerChild.getName().split("\\.")[0]
	This results in this particular item's id being: "innoxia_heartWomb_heart_womb".
	IMPORTANT: If you ever change the name of this .xml, or containing folder, any tattoos that exist in the game will be removed!-->

		<!-- Availability requirements for this tattoo. Use 'npc' for the character receiving the tattoo.
			This field can be left blank if you want the tattoo to always be available.
			The 'unique' attribute determines if this tattoo is a special, unique tattoo.
				If set to true, then this tattoo type won't be granted randomly to NPCs, but will still obey the availability requirements for availability to the player.
			An example for a tattoo that would only be available to the player or feminine NPCs:
				<availabilityRequirements><![CDATA[npc.isPlayer() || npc.isFeminine()]]></availabilityRequirements>
		-->
		<availabilityRequirements unique="false"/>
		
		<!-- The file path for this clothing's image. All images MUST BE .svg format. Colours to be used are described below, above the 'primaryColours' element. I use the free program 'InkScape' to make my .svg images.
				.svg images scale perfectly up and down to any size, so, while it should be a square, it doesn't really matter what size your canvas is (although I use 256x256 as a personal preference).
			You can define any number of 'imageName' elements, all of which will be added to the final svg image.
			Optional attributes are:
				'zLayer' - Use an integer value to determine the layering order of the image, with higher values being rendered on top of images with a lower zLayer value.
				'imageSize' - Use an integer value to scale the image, with 100 being the default size and 0 being so tiny you can't see it.
				'imageRotation' - Use an integer value from 0 to 360, corresponding to the image's rotation in degrees.
			e.g.:
				<imageName zLayer="0" imageSize="25" imageRotation="45">butterflies.svg</imageName>
		 -->
		<imageName>heart_womb.svg</imageName>

		<!-- Use this section to define available colours for your tattoo. The game detects specific colour values, and recolours them to the value chosen by the player. These values are as follows:
			Red is used as base colour for changing the primary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
				#ff2a2a
				#ff5555
				#ff8080
				#ffaaaa
				#ffd5d5
			Orange is used as base colour for changing the secondary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
				#ff7f2a
				#ff9955
				#ffb380
				#ffccaa
				#ffe6d5
			Yellow is used as base colour for changing the tertiary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
				#ffd42a
				#ffdd55
				#ffe680
				#ffeeaa
				#fff6d5
			ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
			You can see a visual representation of these colours here: https://www.lilithsthrone.com/wiki/doku.php?id=modding_wiki:modding:creating_clothes
			Colour lists to be used can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/utils/colours/ColourListPresets.java
		The 'defaultColour' attribute defines what colour should be used as the default colour when a tattoo of this type is generated.
			If omitted or left blank, then the default colour will be set to the first colour out of those that you've defined.
		-->
		<primaryColours values="ALL" defaultColour="CLOTHING_PINK_LIGHT"/>
		<secondaryColours values="ALL" defaultColour="CLOTHING_PINK"/>
		<tertiaryColours values="ALL" defaultColour="CLOTHING_PINK_DARK"/>
		<!-- You can also make your own, custom list of colours to be used. If you want to include custom colours, do not define a 'values' attribute, and instead, list each Colour, like in the example below.
		 Colour types can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/dev/src/com/lilithsthrone/utils/colours/PresetColour.java
		 PLEASE USE THE 'Colour' VALUES THAT START WITH 'CLOTHING-'-->
