        A strange little shop appears in the walkway. It's little more than a ramshackle tent like structure made of
        gauzy cloth. Flickering fire light from inside casts erotically writing shadows against the deceptively thin
        cloth. You can't quit make out what's going on, but the subtle gasps and moans drifting in the air are enough
        to tell you it has to be an intense experience.

    <p>
        There's a strange symbol, cast in gold, mounted above the door. It's not a symbol you recognize, and the more
        you look at it the more your eyes seem to slide off it.

        #IF(pc.isAbleToOrgasm())
            You find yourself unable to move any closer to the shop and get the feeling that you would not be welcome
            inside if you could. You can almost hear it telling you to return only when you seek that which is denied.
        #ELSE
            Somehow, the shape is strangely inviting, as though it wants you to come inside. It hints at a release to
            your yearning, if you're willing to pay the price.
        #ENDIF
