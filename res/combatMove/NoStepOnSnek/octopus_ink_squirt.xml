	<!-- The description of this move.
	The character using this move is passed in as the 'npc' target for parsing, so commands such as [npc.name] will work.
	Special parsing arguments which can be used here are as follows:
	'damageInflicted' will parse to the attacker's projected damage of this attack (using the defined 'baseDamage' field defined below).
	'formattedDamageInflicted' will parse to a formatted damage prediction, taking into account whether or not the target is at maximum lust (therefore taking into account conversion of lust damage to health/mana damage). -->

	<!-- The type of damage that this move inflicts. 
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move (and so conditional statements can be used to affect what damage type is inflicted).

	<!-- The number of turns it takes for this move to become available for use after using it.
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move.
	A value of 0 (or less) means that it can be used as many times as the attacker wants.
	The cooldown is decremented at the end of each combat round, including the current one, so a value of 1 means that this move will be available next turn (and so effectively just limits its use to once per combat turn). -->

	<!-- The number of Action Points that this move costs.
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move.
	Only exceptional abilities or circumstances will alter a character's AP, which is by default 3, so you should take that into account when deciding upon an AP cost (it would normally be best to have it as just 1). -->

	The parsing target of 'npc2' corresponds to the character who is being targeted by the move.
	Note that this weighting is parsed for every combatant, enemy and ally alike, so the method npc2.isCombatAlly(npc) (or npc2.isCombatEnemy(npc)) should most likely be used to differentiate between friend and foe (if you have set this move as being able to be used on both allies and enemies).
	For an interesting example, see the 'spinneret_webbing.xml' file. -->
