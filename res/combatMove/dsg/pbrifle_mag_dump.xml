	A value of 0 (or less) means that it can be used as many times as the attacker wants.
	The cooldown is decremented at the end of each combat round, including the current one, so a value of 1 means that this move will be available next turn (and so effectively just limits its use to once per combat turn). -->

	Note that this weighting is parsed for every combatant, enemy and ally alike, so the method npc2.isCombatAlly(npc) (or npc2.isCombatEnemy(npc)) should most likely be used to differentiate between friend and foe (if you have set this move as being able to be used on both allies and enemies).
