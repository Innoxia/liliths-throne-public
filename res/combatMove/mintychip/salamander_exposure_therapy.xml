	<!-- The number of turns it takes for this move to become available for use after using it.
	The parsing target of 'npc' corresponds to the character who is performing the move.
	A value of 0 (or less) means that it can be used as many times as the attacker wants.
	The cooldown is decremented at the end of each combat round, including the current one, so a value of 1 means that this move will be available next turn (and so effectively just limits its use to once per combat turn). -->
