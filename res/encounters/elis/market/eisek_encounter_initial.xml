	<!-- Encounters will typically be defined within a place type, but if you want to add this encounter to a pre-existing place type which does not have this encounter related to it, then use this section.
	Each of the 'placeType' elements here will have this encounter added to them.
	'innoxia_fields_elis_woods' already has this encounter associated with it, but I've added it here for the sake of providing an example.
	You can have as many 'placeType' elements here as you like.
		Please note that if a place type has multiple different 'possibleEncounters' lists associated with it, one of those lists will be chosen at random to have an encounter drawn from it. -->

			This is highly unlikely to ever be seen by the player, but is used for error handling. -->

			<!-- The 'chanceToTrigger' element needs to return an integer or float value representing a percentage chance of the encounter being triggered when the player triggers this encounter.
			Values should be between 0->100, representing 0%-100% chance.
			The 'opportunisticEncounter' attribute increases the encounter chance based on whether the player is drunk, covered in sexual fluids, at low health, or at high lust.
				This is an option which can be toggled on or off for the player, so don't rely on it too much (it's used in cases where random attackers can be encountered, such as in Dominion's alleyways). -->
