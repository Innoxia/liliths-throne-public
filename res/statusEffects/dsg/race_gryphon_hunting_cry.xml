	<!-- An integer used for determining the order of rendering status effect icons. A higher value means that it's higher up in the rendering priority (and so will be rendered before others).
	Typical values go from 0 to 100.
	A good default value is to set it as 50. As this status effect is a set bonus, it has a higher rendering priority than usual (of 70).
	For some examples of the rendering priority:
	- A character's racial perk effect has a priority of 1000, as I want it to always be rendered first no matter what.
	- Weather effects have a priority of 100 (as I want them to always be displayed as high as possible).
	- Sexual orientation has a priority of 90 (as I want it to be displayed near the start).
	- Most other standard status effects (such as pregnancy, well-rested, alcohol level, etc.) have a priority of 80.
	- Set bonuses have a priority of 70. -->

	<!-- You can use this section to describe any extra effects that this status effect might apply. These effects are shown in the tooltip when the player hovers over the status effect icon.
	The character under the effect is passed in as the 'npc' parsing argument, so if you want to, you can include parsing elements such as [npc.name].
	For this status effect, no extra effects need to be described, but if you need to use this section, use the following format:
	<extraEffects>
		<effect><![CDATA[You're a playful kitty!]]></effect>
	</extraEffects> -->

	<!-- Effect logic -->
	
	<!-- The condition for a status effect to be applied is by default 'false', which means that it can only be applied by a direct method call elsewhere for GameCharacter.addStatusEffect(AbstractStatusEffect statusEffect, int seconds)
	If you would like your status effect to similarly only be applied when called upon, then define this element as:
	<applicationCondition><![CDATA[false]]></applicationCondition>
	If, however, you would like this status effect to be automatically activated once certain conditions are met, then make sure that this element returns a conditional that would result in 'true' (without quotes), as in the example below.
	You must use the game's parsing engine to get what you want.
	You should probably define the attribute shortConditionalCheck="true", as it significantly improves performance of the conditional check. If you do this, you can only define one single conditional line to be parsed (such as in the commented-out example below).
	'npc' is the parser target for the character affected by this status effect.
	To parse something and return a String, use a '#' character at the start of a command, such as: [#npc.isFeminine()]
	To parse something without returning a String (which would most likely not be used in this element), use two '#' characters, such as: [##npc.isFeminine()]
	As a final note, all whitespace is stripped from the returned String before it is parsed into a Boolean. -->
	<applicationCondition><![CDATA[
		false
	]]></applicationCondition>
	<!--The above example is meant to show that you can use the parser to create more "complex" conditionals, but an alternate, simpler example to achieve the same effect would be to just do:
	<applicationCondition shortConditionalCheck="true"><![CDATA[
		SET_BONUS_innoxia_kitty.isCharacterWearingCompleteSet(npc)
	]]></applicationCondition>
	-->
	
	
	<!-- Status effects execute an 'applyEffect(GameCharacter target, int secondsPassed)' method every time the game ends a turn.
	The 'target' is the character who is under the effect of this particular status effect, while the 'secondsPassed' is how much time, in seconds, has passed on this turn.
	During combat, the 'secondsPassed' argument is always 1 (to represent 1 turn ending).
	If the method returns a String, then the game's flow is interrupted to display the 'Important status effects' screen to the player, along with whatever String was returned by this applyEffect() method.
	You can define your own effects to be parsed here, just like hard-coded status effects. While your options are a little limited by what the parser can access, you should be able to apply a good range of effects.
	The 'interval' attribute is an integer representing how often this effect should be applied (measured in seconds).
		For example, an interval of 3600 would make this effect be applied only once per hour (60*60=3600).
		Use an interval of 0 to make this effect be applied on every turn.
	'npc' is the parser target for the character affected by this status effect.
	SECONDS_PASSED is a special tag which is converted into an integer value of the time that passed during the last turn's end (in seconds).
	TOTAL_SECONDS_PASSED is a special tag which is converted into a long value of the total time that's passed while under the effect of this status effect (in seconds).
		This can be used with a TOTAL_SECONDS_PASSED==0 check to, for example, only apply an effect when this status effect is initially added.
	Important note: In combat, 'seconds passed' is actually represented by the number of combat turns passed.
		So, for example, TOTAL_SECONDS_PASSED would be converted into 2 if the character had been under the status effect's influence for two turns in combat.
	As a final note, all tabs are stripped from the returned String after it is parsed, so it's safe to use tabs *not spaces* for formatting.
	This particular status effect does not apply an effect, but if you wanted to apply one, you could do something like this:
	
	<applyEffect interval="3600"><![CDATA[
		#IF(SECONDS_PASSED>0)
			An hour passed!
			#IF(TOTAL_SECONDS_PASSED>(60*60*24))
				[##game.getTextEndStringBuilder().append("<p>This effect has been in effect for more than a day!</p>")]
			#ENDIF
		#ENDIF
	]]></applyEffect>

	<applyEffect/>
	
	<!-- In a similar manner to the 'applyEffect' element above, the game processes logic when a status effect is removed. (This logic is performed while the character is still under the effects of this status effect.) -->
	<applyRemovalEffect/>
	
	<!-- In a similar manner to the 'applyEffect' element above, the game processes logic after a status effect has been removed. (This logic is performed immediately after the effect is removed, so the character is no longer under the effects of this status effect.) -->
	<applyPostRemovalEffect/>
