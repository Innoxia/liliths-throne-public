	<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION: If you are unsure of anything, please use the LT Discord to ask for help!
	Your tattoo's id (which is very important to the game), is calculated from your tattoo's folder and .xml name using the following code:
		modAuthorDirectory.getName()+"_"+innerChild.getParentFile().getName()+"_"+innerChild.getName().split("\\.")[0]
	This results in this particular item's id being: "innoxia_hearts_hearts".
	IMPORTANT: If you ever change the name of this .xml, or containing folder, any tattoos that exist in the game will be removed!-->

		<!-- The file path for this clothing's image. All images MUST BE .svg format. Colours to be used are described below, above the 'primaryColours' element. I use the free program 'InkScape' to make my .svg images.
		 .svg images scale perfectly up and down to any size, so, while it should be a square, it doesn't really matter what size your canvas is (although I use 256x256 as a personal preference).-->
