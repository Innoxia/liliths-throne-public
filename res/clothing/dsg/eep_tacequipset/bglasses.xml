	<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION: If you are unsure of anything, please use the LT Discord to ask for help!
	Your clothing's id (which is very important to the game), is calculated from your clothing's folder and .xml name using the following code:
		modAuthorDirectory.getName()+"_"+innerChild.getParentFile().getName()+"_"+innerChild.getName().split("\\.")[0]
	This results in this particular item's id being: "innoxia_rentalMommy_rental_mommy".
	IMPORTANT: If you ever change the name of this .xml, or containing folder, any items of this clothing that exist in the game will be removed!-->

If multiple 'blockedParts' block or conceal the same slot, only one 'blockedParts' needs to be displaced to reveal it. (e.g. If a pair of trousers has 'UNZIPS' and 'PULLS_DOWN' displacementTypes, and both of these contain the 'concealedSlots' 'slot' 'PENIS', then the penis will be revealed if either UNZIPS or PULLS_DOWN is activated.)

		<!-- Your clothing can be coloured any way you like, but if you'd like the player to be able to dye your clothing, you can specify available colours here. primaryColours, secondaryColours, and tertiaryColours can all spawn in as a default colour, while their 'Dye' counterparts are only available if the player chooses to dye the clothing in that colour. The game detects specific colour values, and recolours them to the value chosen by the player. These values are as follows:
		Red is used as base colour for changing the primary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff2a2a
			#ff5555
			#ff8080
			#ffaaaa
			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for changing the secondary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff7f2a
			#ff9955
			#ffb380
			#ffccaa
			#ffe6d5
		Yellow is used as base colour for changing the tertiary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ffd42a
			#ffdd55
			#ffe680
			#ffeeaa
			#fff6d5
		ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
		You can see a visual representation of these colours here: https://www.lilithsthrone.com/wiki/doku.php?id=modding_wiki:modding:creating_clothes

		<!-- You can also make your own, custom list of colours to be used. The following colours in 'tertiaryColoursDye' are all found within the list preset 'ALL', but this is for a demonstration.
		 If you want to include custom colours, do not define a 'values' attribute, and instead, list each Colour.
