	<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION: If you are unsure of anything, please use the LT Discord to ask for help!
	Your clothing's id (which is very important to the game), is calculated from your clothing's folder and .xml name using the following code:
		modAuthorDirectory.getName()+"_"+innerChild.getParentFile().getName()+"_"+innerChild.getName().split("\\.")[0]
	This results in this particular item's id being: "innoxia_rentalMommy_rental_mommy".
	IMPORTANT: If you ever change the name of this .xml, or containing folder, any items of this clothing that exist in the game will be removed!-->

				'defaultSticker' defines whether this sticker is applied to this clothing item by default when spawned in.
				'zLayer' defines the rendering z-layer priority. These 'zLayer' values are compared against one another when rendering, with higher values being drawn on top of stickers with lower values. *The base svg has a zLayer value of 0*, meaning that negative values will be drawn beneath the base svg. Defining zLayer as 0 is not advised (although it is handled by always being drawn on top of the base layer).
				'colourDisabled' and 'colourSelected' are optional variables which you can use to define the colour of the text within the button used to select this sticker in the clothing dye UI. You can leave these blank or delete them entirely to use default button colours. The default values, if you were to define them using these variables, would look like:
				colourDisabled="TEXT_GREY" colourSelected="GENERIC_GOOD"
				(Note: If you do not define an 'imageName' variable, or if you leave it blank, the default selected colour will be TEXT_GREY instead of GENERIC_GOOD.)

			#ffaaaa

		Orange is used as base colour for changing the secondary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff7f2a
			#ff9955
			#ffb380
			#ffccaa
			#ffe6d5
		Yellow is used as base colour for changing the tertiary colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
