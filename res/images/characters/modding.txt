----- CUSTOM ARTOWORK GUIDE -----

All images must be .png or .jpg!

In order for them to display properly in-game, you need to call the NPC's folder the same name as the NPC's class name.
NPC class names can be seen here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/tree/master/src/com/lilithsthrone/game/character/npc

Within these NPC folders, you'll need to add a new artist folder.
The artist folder name **MUST BE SPECIFIED** in an artist's .xml file. (Use the 'artistJam.xml' as a template.)

Within the new artist-name folder, you need to name the images as 'clothedX', 'partialX', or 'nakedX', where X is a number starting at 1.
These names determine which images are always visible (those named 'clothedX'), and which images are only shown after having sex with the character (those named 'partialX' and 'nakedX').

Example:
To add custom images for Rose, you'd need to:
1) Create an 'artistX.xml' file (where X is whatever name you'd like), in the exact same format and location as the attached artistJam.xml file. For this example, we'll use the artist name 'mod'.
2) Within Rose's folder, create a new folder called 'mod' (or 'Mod' - the case doesn't matter).
3) Within this folder, place your images of Rose. In this example, let's say you're adding two images of her with clothing on, and one with her being naked.
4) Rename the images accordingly. In this example, the images would be called 'clothed1', 'clothed2', and 'naked1'.
5) Start (or restart) the game, and the images should display.

Example 2:
To add custom images for Candi, you'd need to:
1) Create a new folder alongside all the other character folders, called 'brandi'.
2) FOllow the steps as outlined in Rose's example above.


SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS:

Brax has the folders 'brax', 'bree', and 'brandi' for his TFs.

Lilaya has the folders 'lilayaPale', 'lilayaLight', 'lilayaOlive', 'lilayaDark', 'lilayaEbony' for the variations of her skin tone. (Based on your character's starting skin tone.)
