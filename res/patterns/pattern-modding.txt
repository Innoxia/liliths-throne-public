Hey there! A message from Irbynx on how to do stuff with patterns if you are a modder!

They don't have the full functionality to make them perfectly work yet; for now stick to using primary colors (shades of red or non-replaceable colors like black and white) and keep shapes for patterns either as paths or as rectangles.

To add a pattern:
* Make an SVG that would look good as a 'background pattern'. Have it's background color match the primary color (one of the red colors so the dye brush could change it in game)
* Name the item using lower case and underscores (_) where the spaces should be. The name will be used in game, so name your things like "tiger_striped.svg" or "cow_patterned.svg"; it will replace underscores with spaces and capitalize as necessary.
* That's it! Adding a pattern is actually kinda easy. Keep shapes as paths or rectangles and don't use orange/yellow replacement colors for now, however, as this feature isn't polished yet.

To add support of patterns to an item (clothing only):
* Get your item's SVG image.
* Find the area you want to have the patterns. Color it with a single fill and make sure to keep line art separate from it.
* Put that area in the layer named "patternLayer". This layer will be completely replaced by the pattern in game if the item has one!
* Use a single shape in there; due to a JavaFX bug that I can't identify yet, it doesn't like multiple shapes, so Unify them if needed (for example, for gloves).
* That's it! No XML editing required.
