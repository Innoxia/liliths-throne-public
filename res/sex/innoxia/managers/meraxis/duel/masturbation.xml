<sexManager>

	<!-- Sex managers are used to define behaviour and limitations during sex scenes, and can be reused in as many responses as you want by calling its id.
		The id for a SexManager is calculated from the folder path and this xml file name.
		In this case, the id would be: 'innoxia_meraxis_masturbation'
	
	Please note that SexManagers are always used in conjunction with a scene's response, and it's within the response that the starting position is defined, as well as all of the dominant and submissive characters and their starting SexSlots.
		The sexStartContent and postSexDialogue scenes are also defined within the response; a SexManager is concerned solely with behaviour during the sex scene itself.
		The information for characters in this file is so that *if* that character is added to the sex scene then this manager can define their behaviour.
		You do not need to add all of the characters defined within this file to the sex scene, nor do you need to define all the characters in the sex scene within this file.
		If definitions are missing for a character, default values will be used.
	
	You have a significant amount more control over characters behaviour during sex if you use a SexManager in your responses (rather than a generic sex scene).
		To give you the most control, there are a lot of elements in this file, although a significant amount of them are optional, and if so will be marked as such along with their default value if omitted, like so: 'OPTIONAL: Default true'
		Please note that it's recommended to omit the fields marked as being OPTIONAL if you aren't sure of the behaviour you want.
		
	All of the values which have CDATA support are run through the game's parser either every time they're checked or once when sex is initialised.
		This is marked as such: 'PARSER: Every check' or 'PARSER: Initial'
		
	Elements which are defined as returning either 'true' or 'false' should always return either 'true' or 'false'.
	
	Note: In elements which are of a list type (such as the 'slot' elements within 'slotsAvailable'), a blank value will be discarded, so if you want conditional statements to sometimes return nothing, it's safe to return just whitespace to do so.

				Please note that this doesn't work for self-action preferences.
				The player character doesn't ever need these preferences set, as control is in the hands of the person playing the game, but for an example:
					This would result in a character wanting to receive (from Epona) cunnilingus for foreplay, and vaginal sex for main sex:
					<preferences>
						<character id="epona">

								<performing><![CDATA[ORIFICE_VAGINA]]></performing>
								<targeted><![CDATA[PENETRATION_PENIS]]></targeted>
							</mainSex>
						</character>
					</preferences>
				Note: You can define the optional boolean attribute 'copyForMain' in the 'foreplay' element, which when set to true will make this character use the defined foreplay preferences as their main sex preference as well, allowing you to omit the 'mainSex' element entirely.
					e.g.: <foreplay copyForMain="true">
				OPTIONAL: Default is that preferences are calculated from available areas, fetishes, and the player's content options
				PARSER: Initial -->
			<preferences/>
			
			<!-- You can define unique sex actions for this character to have available to them here.
				OPTIONAL: Default is that no unique sex actions are added -->

			<!-- The sex types which are banned from this character during the sex scene.
				Note that if a sex type is blocked via use of this element, then the reverse sex type is also blocked for the partner (i.e. blocking this character from performing blowjobs will also block partners from getting a blowjob from this character).
				If for example you wanted to just prevent this character from performing blowjobs, then you could define it like so:
					<sexTypesBanned>
						<sexType>
							<performing>ORIFICE_MOUTH</performing>
							<targeted>PENETRATION_PENIS</targeted>
						</sexType>
					</sexTypesBanned>
				OPTIONAL: Default is that no sex types are banned -->
			<sexTypesBanned/>
			
			<!-- The areas of this character which are not allowed to be used by anyone during the sex scene.
				If the optional 'appliesToSelf' attribute is set to true, then these area limitations will also affect this character's self actions (it defaults to false if excluded).
					e.g. (For just feet being excluded for some reason)
						<areasBanned appliesToSelf="true">
							<sexArea><![CDATA[PENETRATION_FOOT]]></sexArea>
						</areasBanned>
				OPTIONAL: Default is that all areas are available for use
				PARSER: Initial -->
			<areasBanned/>
			
			<!-- The conditions under which this character wants to end the current sex scene (and will do so if their level of control allows for it).
				The player character is not affected by this, as the decision to end sex lies with the person playing the game.
				An example of this would be:
					<stopSexCondition><![CDATA[
						[#sex.isSatisfiedFromOrgasms(meraxis, true) && sex.isOrgasmCountMet(pc, 1, true)]
					]]></stopSexCondition>
				OPTIONAL: Default is that the character factors in orgasms and arousal to decide whether to end sex or not
				PARSER: Every check -->
			<stopSexCondition/>
			
			<!-- All characters have generic lines to use for dirty talk during sex, but you can override those by defining lines here.
				OPTIONAL: Default is that the character uses their default lines
				PARSER: Every check -->

				<!-- The dirty talk within this element will only apply when targeting the character which corresponds to the supplied id (in this case Meraxis). -->
				<character id="meraxis">
					<!-- 'standard' lines are the ones which are most commonly seen and used by characters.
					The optional attribute 'additionToDefault' determines whether these lines are added alongside default ones (true), or if only these standard lines should be used in this scene (false).
						This attribute defaults to true, and when set to true, there's a 50/50 chance of a default line or one of your custom ones being used.
						In this example, I want to replace all standard dirty talk with the player telling Meraxis to keep on playing with her breasts, so I set this to false.
						OPTIONAL: Default is that the character uses their default standard lines -->
					<standard additionToDefault="false">
						<!-- You can define the following optional attributes:
								'performing': this line will only be used when this character is using this sex area on the target (defaults to no requirement).
								'targeted': this line will only be used when this character is interacting with the target's sex area (defaults to no requirement).
								'performingAnyPenetration': If set to true, this line will only be used if this character is performing any virginity-taking penetration on the target (defaults to false).
								'takingAnyPenetration': If set to true, this line will only be used if this character is receiving any virginity-taking penetration from the target (defaults to false).
									Penetrations which take virginity are penis, tail, clit, and tentacle (with tongue, finger, and foot not taking virginities).
								'extraNoises': If set to false, then no sex noises, slurred speech, or other non-personality speech modifiers will automatically be inserted into this line (defaults to true).
									e.g. If omitted or set to true, then a line of "Keep going, fuck me!" might end up being parsed to "Keep ~Aah!~ going, fuck, ~Mmm!~ me!"
							Examples:
								<line performing="PENETRATION_PENIS" targeted="ORIFICE_VAGINA"><![CDATA[Your pussy feels so good squeezing down on my cock!]]></line>
								<line performingAnyPenetration="true"><![CDATA[You're a good fuck!]]></line>
								<line takingAnyPenetration="true" extraNoises="false"><![CDATA[~Ooh!~ That's it! ~Mmm!~ Don't stop!]]></line>
							So for this example, the player will only use this line when using their penis to penetrate Meraxis's vagina (which in this scene is impossible, so it's just an example for the sake of providing one).
							You can define as many 'line' elements as you'd like.
							The parsing target 'npc' will be linked to the speaker when parsed (in this case the player).
							The parsing target 'npc2' will be linked to the target when parsed (in this case Meraxis).
							Style advice: You should probably not replace the player's default lines, or if you do then please only make them as specific as the sex scene itself.
								i.e. If you make a generic sex scene, it would be jarring for the player to have their character use very specific fetish talk towards their partner.
								However, if your sex scene is a special one with a lot of custom behaviour, then it would enhance the scene to give the player some specific dirty talk. -->
