		<!-- The description that's used when equipping this weapon. The description should be generic, able to be used by both the player and NPCs. Just make sure to use the tag "[npc.verb()]" whenever using a verb, which will then, for example, parse like this:
		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is player = "run"
		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is not the player = "runs"
		Always use the first-person singular verb.
		The target "npc" OR "npc1" should be used for the character using the weapon. e.g. If the player is the one attacking (and is called Innoxia), then [npc.Name] will return "Innoxia"
		The target "npc2" should be used for the character being attacked. e.g. If Brax is the one being attacked, then [npc2.Name] will return "Brax"

		<!-- The effects that this weapon spawns in with. Remember that the player can remove/change/add effects. To know what to put in here, it would probably be easiest to enchant clothing in your game, save the game, then copy over that clothing's 'effects' in your save file.
		There are two special values for secondaryModifier, which are: RESISTANCE_WEAPON and DAMAGE_WEAPON
		RESISTANCE_WEAPON applies the related resistance of this weapon's damage type, while DAMAGE_WEAPON applies the related damage type.
		For example, if this dagger spawned in as type POISON, and I'd replaced both instances of CRITICAL_CHANCE with DAMAGE_WEAPON, then this dagger would spawn with two +5 Poison Damage effects.-->
		<effects/>
		
		<!-- Your clothing can be coloured any way you like, but if you'd like the player to be able to dye your clothing, you can specify available colours here. primaryColours and secondaryColours all spawn in as a default colour, while their 'Dye' counterparts are only available if the player chooses to dye the clothing in that colour. The game detects specific colour values, and recolours them to the value chosen by the player. These values are as follows:
		Red is used as base colour for changing the DAMAGE TYPE's colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff2a2a
			#ff5555
			#ff8080
			#ffaaaa
			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for changing the PRIMARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff7f2a
			#ff9955
			#ffb380
			#ffccaa
			#ffe6d5
		Yellow is used as base colour for changing the SECONDARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ffd42a
			#ffdd55
			#ffe680
			#ffeeaa
			#fff6d5
		As you can see above, weapons differ from clothing in that their 'Red' colour is recoloured based on the weapon's damage type! The "primaryColours" and "secondaryColours" defined below are for recolouring the Orange and Yellow values, respectively.
			
		ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
		You can see a visual representation of these colours (as used in clothing) here: https://www.lilithsthrone.com/wiki/doku.php?id=modding_wiki:modding:creating_clothes
