			Continuing with the javelin example, you'd probably want to define this element as something like 'throw [npc.her] javelin at' to make "Throw your javelin at your enemy for N damage!"
			You should use the parsing target of 'npc' for the character using this weapon, and if needed, you can also use 'npc2' for the targeted character.

		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is not the player = "runs"
		Always use the first-person singular verb.
		The target "npc" OR "npc1" should be used for the character using the weapon. e.g. If the player is the one attacking (and is called Innoxia), then [npc.Name] will return "Innoxia"
		The target "npc2" should be used for the character being attacked. e.g. If Brax is the one being attacked, then [npc2.Name] will return "Brax"

			<spell damageType="PHYSICAL">SLAM</spell>
			<spell damageType="POISON">POISON_VAPOURS</spell>
		</spells>
		
		The 'changeOnReforge' variable determines whether this weapon should regenerate spells whenever the player changes the damage type. (i.e. If they reforge a FIRE dagger to an ICE dagger, if 'changeOnReforge' is true, then the granted spell FIREBALL will automatically switch to ICE_SHARD).
		
		The 'damageType' variable corresponds to the damageType which causes the spell to be unlocked when this weapon is spawned in. You can have multiple entries of the same damageType, like so:
		...
			<spell damageType="FIRE">FIREBALL</spell>
			<spell damageType="FIRE">FLASH</spell>
			<spell damageType="FIRE">ICE_SHARD</spell>
			<spell damageType="FIRE">STEAL</spell>
		...
		Note that the damageType does not have to correspond to the spell's school (so FIRE can unlock ICE_SHARD, etc.).

		<combatMoves changeOnReforge="true">
			<move damageType="PHYSICAL">ASSAULT_RIFLE_MAG_DUMP</move>
		</combatMoves>
		
		The 'changeOnReforge' variable determines whether this weapon should regenerate combat moves whenever the player changes the damage type. (i.e. If they reforge a PHYSICAL dagger to an ICE dagger, if 'changeOnReforge' is true, then the granted combat move ASSAULT_RIFLE_MAG_DUMP will be lost).
		
		The 'damageType' variable corresponds to the damageType which causes the move to be unlocked when this weapon is spawned in. You can have multiple entries of the same damageType, like so:
		...
			<move damageType="FIRE">EXAMPLE_MOVE_1</move>
			<move damageType="FIRE">EXAMPLE_MOVE_2</move>
			<move damageType="FIRE">EXAMPLE_MOVE_3</move>

		<!-- The effects that this weapon spawns in with. Remember that the player can remove/change/add effects. To know what to put in here, it would probably be easiest to enchant a weapon in your game, save the game, then copy over that weapon's 'effects' in your save file.
		There are two special values for secondaryModifier, which are: RESISTANCE_WEAPON and DAMAGE_WEAPON
		RESISTANCE_WEAPON applies the related resistance of this weapon's damage type, while DAMAGE_WEAPON applies the related damage type.
		For example, if this dagger spawned in as type POISON, and I'd replaced both instances of CRITICAL_CHANCE with DAMAGE_WEAPON, then this dagger would spawn with two +5 Poison Damage effects.-->

		<!-- You can use this section to describe any extra features of this weapon.
		These effects are shown in the tooltip when the player hovers over the weapon icon, so try and keep them short (as they should fit on one line).
		It should probably only be used to describe what happens in the <onHitEffect> element.
		No characters are passed in as parsing arguments, so you should NOT use any character-specific parsing elements (such as [npc.name]).
		For this weapon, no extra effects need to be described, but if you need to use this section, use the following format:
		<extraEffects>
			<effect><![CDATA[Stab time!]]></effect>
		</extraEffects> -->
		<extraEffects/>
		
		<!-- This is applied every time this weapon hits a target. It does NOT apply when the weapon critically hits.
		The returned text is appended to the hit description.
		'npc' corresponds to the attacker, and 'npc2' to the target, for use in effects/parsing.
		For this weapon, no hit effects need to be added, but if you need to use this section, use the following format:
		<onHitEffect><![CDATA[
		[##npc2.setHealth(0)]
		[npc2.Name] is instantly defeated!

		<onHitEffect/>
	
		<!-- This is applied every time this weapon critically hits a target. It does NOT apply when the weapon does a non-critical hit.

		Use the exact same format as onHitEffect (the element above). -->

		<!-- Your weapon can be coloured any way you like, but if you'd like the player to be able to dye your weapon, you can specify available colours here. primaryColours and secondaryColours all spawn in as a default colour, while their 'Dye' counterparts are only available if the player chooses to dye the weapon in that colour. The game detects specific colour values, and recolours them to the value chosen by the player. These values are as follows:
		Red is used as base colour for changing the DAMAGE TYPE's colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff2a2a
			#ff5555
			#ff8080
			#ffaaaa
			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for changing the PRIMARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff7f2a
			#ff9955
			#ffb380
			#ffccaa
			#ffe6d5
		Yellow is used as base colour for changing the SECONDARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ffd42a
			#ffdd55
			#ffe680
			#ffeeaa
			#fff6d5
		Green is used as base colour for changing the TERTIARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#abc837
			#bcd35f
			#cdde87
			#dde9af
			#eef4d7
		As you can see above, weapons differ from weapon in that their 'Red' colour is recoloured based on the weapon's damage type! The "primaryColours", "secondaryColours", and "tertiaryColours" defined below are for recolouring the Orange, Yellow, and Green values, respectively.
			
		ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
		You can see a visual representation of these colours (as used in clothing) here: https://www.lilithsthrone.com/wiki/doku.php?id=modding_wiki:modding:creating_clothes
