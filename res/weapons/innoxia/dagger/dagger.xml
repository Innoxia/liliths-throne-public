		<!-- The description that's used when equipping this weapon. The description should be generic, able to be used by both the player and NPCs. Just make sure to use the tag "[npc.verb()]" whenever using a verb, which will then, for example, parse like this:
		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is player = "run"
		[npc.verb(run)] if npc is not the player = "runs"
		Always use the first-person singular verb.
		The target "npc" OR "npc1" should be used for the character using the weapon. e.g. If the player is the one attacking (and is called Innoxia), then [npc.Name] will return "Innoxia"
		The target "npc2" should be used for the character being attacked. e.g. If Brax is the one being attacked, then [npc2.Name] will return "Brax"

			<spell damageType="LUST">ARCANE_AROUSAL</spell>
			<spell damageType="PHYSICAL">SLAM</spell>
			<spell damageType="POISON">POISON_VAPOURS</spell>
		</spells>
		
		The 'changeOnReforge' variable determines whether this weapon should regenerate spells whenever the player changes the damage type. (i.e. If they reforge a FIRE dagger to an ICE dagger, if 'changeOnReforge' is true, then the granted spell FIREBALL will automatically switch to ICE_SHARD).
		
		The 'damageType' variable corresponds to the damageType which causes the spell to be unlocked when this weapon is spawned in. You can have multiple entries of the same damageType, like so:
		...
			<spell damageType="FIRE">FIREBALL</spell>
			<spell damageType="FIRE">FLASH</spell>
			<spell damageType="FIRE">ICE_SHARD</spell>
			<spell damageType="FIRE">STEAL</spell>
		...
		Note that the damageType does not have to correspond to the spell's school (so FIRE can unlock ICE_SHARD, etc.).

		<combatMoves changeOnReforge="true">
			<move damageType="PHYSICAL">ASSAULT_RIFLE_MAG_DUMP</move>
		</combatMoves>
		
		The 'changeOnReforge' variable determines whether this weapon should regenerate combat moves whenever the player changes the damage type. (i.e. If they reforge a PHYSICAL dagger to an ICE dagger, if 'changeOnReforge' is true, then the granted combat move ASSAULT_RIFLE_MAG_DUMP will be lost).
		
		The 'damageType' variable corresponds to the damageType which causes the spell to be unlocked when this weapon is spawned in. You can have multiple entries of the same damageType, like so:

		<!-- The effects that this weapon spawns in with. Remember that the player can remove/change/add effects. To know what to put in here, it would probably be easiest to enchant clothing in your game, save the game, then copy over that clothing's 'effects' in your save file.
		There are two special values for secondaryModifier, which are: RESISTANCE_WEAPON and DAMAGE_WEAPON
		RESISTANCE_WEAPON applies the related resistance of this weapon's damage type, while DAMAGE_WEAPON applies the related damage type.
		For example, if this dagger spawned in as type POISON, and I'd replaced both instances of CRITICAL_CHANCE with DAMAGE_WEAPON, then this dagger would spawn with two +5 Poison Damage effects.-->

		<!-- Your clothing can be coloured any way you like, but if you'd like the player to be able to dye your clothing, you can specify available colours here. primaryColours and secondaryColours all spawn in as a default colour, while their 'Dye' counterparts are only available if the player chooses to dye the clothing in that colour. The game detects specific colour values, and recolours them to the value chosen by the player. These values are as follows:
		Red is used as base colour for changing the DAMAGE TYPE's colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff2a2a
			#ff5555
			#ff8080
			#ffaaaa
			#ffd5d5
		Orange is used as base colour for changing the PRIMARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ff7f2a
			#ff9955
			#ffb380
			#ffccaa
			#ffe6d5
		Yellow is used as base colour for changing the SECONDARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#ffd42a
			#ffdd55
			#ffe680
			#ffeeaa
			#fff6d5
		Green is used as base colour for changing the TERTIARY colour of the graphic in-game, and the game will only recognise and change the following colours:
			#abc837
			#bcd35f
			#cdde87
			#dde9af
			#eef4d7
		As you can see above, weapons differ from clothing in that their 'Red' colour is recoloured based on the weapon's damage type! The "primaryColours", "secondaryColours", and "tertiaryColours" defined below are for recolouring the Orange, Yellow, and Green values, respectively.
			
		ANY GRADIENTS THAT YOU USE SHOULD BE CALLED: "innoGrad1", "innoGrad2", etc.
		You can see a visual representation of these colours (as used in clothing) here: https://www.lilithsthrone.com/wiki/doku.php?id=modding_wiki:modding:creating_clothes
		Colour lists to be used can be found here: https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/master/src/com/lilithsthrone/utils/ColourListPresets.java -->
		<primaryColours recolouringAllowed="true" values="JUST_STEEL"/> <!-- You can leave the attribute 'recolouringAllowed' out of colour definitions. If you want the player to be unable to change this colour, then set it as false. This is only used in very niche situations (such as for the filly choker).-->
		<primaryColoursDye values="ALL_METAL"/>

		<!-- You can define any number of custom colours to replace the shades you've coloured your svg with.
		If you have used the primary/secondary/tertiary elements up above, then do not use their associated colour hexes.
		(i.e. If you've defined a primaryColours element, do not use #ff7f2a, #ff9955, #ffb380, #ffccaa, or #ffe6d5 in the customColour attributes.)
		
		You should NEVER use the primary recolouring shades, as they are always reserved for the damage type's colour:
		#ff2a2a, #ff5555, #ff8080, #ffaaaa, or #ffd5d5
