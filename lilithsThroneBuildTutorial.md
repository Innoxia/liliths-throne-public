This is most likely because you have already have an outdated build open as a project. Make note of the directory it is reporting as not being empty.
1. Close the import wizard
2. In the Package Explorer, right click the project, and click Delete
3. Make sure you select "Delete Project Contents on Disk". If you don't do this, you will have to do it manually in Windows File Explorer.
