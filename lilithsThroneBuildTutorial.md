## Help
#### No Launch Configuration OR "Could not find main method from given launch configuration."
1. First close the Export wizard, and click on the icon in the top of the left pane.
2. Select the Project in the Package Explorer
3. In the top bar, click Project, and then Properties
4. In the left column, select Run/Debug Settings
5. In the right column, click New
6. Choose Java Application, and click OK
7. A Wizard will open, click Search next to the "Main Class" Box

####  "C:\Users\[USERNAME]\git\liliths-throne-public is not an empty directory."
**This is the same error as "Some or all projects cannot be imported as they already exist in the workspace"**

This is most likely because you have already have an outdated build open as a project. Make note of the directory it is reporting as not being empty.
1. Close the import wizard
2. In the Package Explorer, right click the project, and click Delete
3. Make sure you select "Delete Project Contents on Disk". If you don't do this, you will have to do it manually in Windows File Explorer.
4. Try Importing again

####  Eclipse stuck on importing from Git
The GIT plugin of Eclipse tries to run the "bash" command, and if you hadn't installed Windows Subsystem for Linux  properly, it may cause problems with import.
1. In "Turn Windows features on or off", check if Windows Subsystem for Linux is activated.
2. If it's active, try to execute "bash" in Command Prompt.
3. If result contains the phrase "Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions", then you have to install Linux distribution. Fortunately, the basic setup can be done with just one command.
4. Run "lxrun /install" in Command Prompt, type "y" to continue, after that - enter some username and password.
5. Run "bash" in Command Prompt once. If the appearance of the console changes, then you've succeeded.
6. Try Importing once again.
