> **IMPORTANT:** Your mod must have been created according to [these instructions](new-mod.md).  If you have not read that document, please do so before continuing!

This document will teach you how to add weapons to Lilith's Throne.

Please note that it is not currently possible to add a weapon that can *kill* a character without large game engine changes.  Such changes will not be made by the developer and will not be discussed.
