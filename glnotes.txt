NOTES:
-Need custom text for quest "Knocked up" when Lilaya impregnates PC
	-Special variant for when PC has ONLY had sex with Lilaya

-The "paternity" stuff re. pregnancy and children is a bit off-putting. It would be better to track both parents, since honestly neither mother nor father seems to matter much in this world.
	-Actually, that could (should?) be revamped a bit; if kids run off a few hours after being born, familial relations wouldn't mean much at all, which would create all kinds of narrative weirdness.
	-You might consider adding some kind of magical connection between parents and children, which would (a) explain how they get their knowledge and (b) explain why parentage actually matters here.

-Need options to tail-fuck your partner various ways

-A little more "out there" idea - inspired by that story I linked you to - is to make succubus tails capable of ejaculating (possibly have a "lesser" tail that's a spade, and a "greater" tail that can transform between spade and phallic tipped). Would provide an interesting "non-futa" way for female demons to impregnate other females (or themselves?).

-Skirts should not block wearing/removing panties/hose

-One of the scenes - Kate, I think - describes her pulling up her skirt, but it's not "pulled up" in the sex scene.

-Need custom text for encountering an NPC who has given birth to PC's children, or vice versa

-Succubus characters should probably gain the ability to morph body parts during sex at some point (makes sense, if other succubi can do the same)

-Should add "ask for creampie"/"ask to pull out" to NCPs (and reactions if you do/don't do what they ask)
	-Probably have Lilaya get especially annoyed if you don't pull out

-Could possibly be able to do up to X simultaneous breast actions where X is number of breasts, i.e. finger nipples and tailfuck nipples at the same time, since you obviously have two that can be played with. Might be a pain to code, though.

-HUGE UI improvement: in addition to having actions 1-10 corresponding to number keys, add a movable cursor (using the same directional keys as map movement) and a hotkey to select an action. This has a bunch of advantages:
	-Can easily select any option with the keyboard (i.e. playing one-handed with your hand on the home row; you don't have to move off the home row to select any option, just arrow to it and select it)
	-Can add 2nd, 3rd etc. rows of actions and still have them selectable with the keyboard
	-Visible cursor feedback makes it less likely to accidentally choose the wrong action

-Need some way to turn the tables and fuck Pix

-Should bump up priority on making used condoms do something, if it's not too much work.

BUGS:
-Transformation options in succubus sex encounter seem to be permanent. Ish. I'm not sure what the conditions are, but having her grow a cock caused her to ALWAYS have it in future scenes; removing her vagina caused it to disappear permanently.
~This should be fixed now.~

-As of 1.69.9 doing the "dominant" route with Brax seems to freeze the game. Entering debug menu allowed me to escape, but I wasn't able to do the scene at all.
~Fixed~

-Eye colour options aren't working. Clicking "Eye Colour" at Kate's just refreshes the menu, but clicking anything except "Leave" acts like you paid to get your existing eye colour.

-No option to stop sex during doggy style, but "Start anal" button appears while doing vaginal doggy, but appears to do nothing. "Pull out" at orgasm does nothing, either.

-Continue/pull out option should trigger on PENETRATOR orgasm, not penetrated orgasm

-Make sure to push fix for reading file templates!
~Done ^^~

-Hover descriptions for actions are displaying the wrong text
~Fixed~

-Fertility at 100 doesn't give "certainty" pregnant chance
